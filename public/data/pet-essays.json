I’m really looking forward to seeing everyone and celebrating your birthday. You mentioned that you need some help. What time should I arrive to help you prepare? Also, is there anything specific you would like me to bring, like some snacks or drinks? I can easily go to the supermarket on my way. Just let me know what you need. See you on Saturday! Best, Sam",

    "title": "A Surprise in the Garden",
    "english_text": "The story started when I heard a strange noise outside my window. I decided to go and see what it was. In the garden, I saw a small box under the big apple tree. It was wet from the rain, so I picked it up carefully and took it inside. When I opened it, I found a tiny kitten! It was scared and hungry. I gave it some warm milk and a soft blanket. I decided to call him Storm because I found him during a storm. It was the best and most unexpected surprise I have ever had.",
    "chinese_translation": "故事始于我听到窗外传来一阵奇怪的声音。我决定去看看是什么。在花园里，我看到一棵大苹果树下有一个小盒子。它被雨淋湿了，所以我小心翼翼地把它捡起来带进屋里。当我打开它时，我发现了一只小猫！它又害怕又饿。我给了它一些温牛奶和一条柔软的毯子。我决定叫他“风暴”，因为我是在暴风雨中发现他的。这是我遇到过的最好、最意想不到的惊喜。"
