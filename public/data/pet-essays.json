    "english_text": "Last weekend, I went on a trip to the mountains with my family. We stayed in a small, cozy cabin. On Saturday, we decided to go hiking. The path was quite steep, but the views from the top were absolutely amazing! We could see the entire valley below us, and the air was so fresh and clean. In the evening, we made a campfire and told stories. I felt so relaxed and happy. It was a wonderful break from the city, and I would love to go back again soon. It was the best weekend I've had in a long time.",

    "english_text": "My favorite hobby is photography. I got my first camera as a birthday gift two years ago, and I have loved it ever since. I enjoy taking pictures of nature the most, especially flowers and animals. It makes me look at the world in a different way, as I'm always searching for a beautiful scene to capture. Last month, one of my photos won a small competition at my school, which made me very proud. Photography is a creative and relaxing activity. I hope to get a better camera one day to improve my skills even more.",
    "chinese_translation": "我最喜欢的爱好是摄影。两年前，我收到了我的第一台相机作为生日礼物，从那时起我就爱上了它。我最喜欢拍摄大自然的照片，特别是花卉和动物。它让我以一种不同的方式看待世界，因为我总是在寻找一个美丽的场景来捕捉。上个月，我的一张照片在我们学校的一个小比赛中获奖了，这让我感到非常自豪。摄影是一项有创意和放松的活动。我希望有一天能有一台更好的相机，以进一步提高我的技能。"
