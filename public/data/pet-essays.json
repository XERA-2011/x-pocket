    "english_text": "My favourite hobby is photography. I got my first camera from my parents as a birthday gift last year, and I have loved it ever since. I enjoy taking photos of nature, especially flowers and animals in the park near my home. It's a very creative and relaxing activity. Last weekend, I took a beautiful picture of a sunset. My dream is to travel the world and take photos of different places. I think it's a wonderful way to capture memories and see the world from a new perspective. It has taught me to be patient and to look for beauty everywhere.",

    "english_text": "I'd like to tell you about a film I really enjoyed called 'The Lion King'. It's an animated film about a young lion cub named Simba who is destined to rule the African savanna. The story is very emotional, and the music is fantastic. My favourite character is Timon because he is very funny and always makes me laugh. I watched it with my family at home last month, and we all loved it. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys adventure stories with great songs. It's a classic movie that is perfect for all ages.",
