    "english_text": "I had a fantastic weekend! On Saturday morning, I went to the park with my friends. We played football for about two hours, which was great fun. Afterwards, we were really hungry, so we went to a small cafe and had some delicious pizza. On Sunday, I stayed at home and helped my parents with some gardening. In the evening, I watched a new film with my family. It was a comedy and we all laughed a lot. It was a simple but very relaxing weekend, and I feel ready for the week ahead.",

    "title": "A Place I Love to Visit",
    "english_text": "A place I absolutely love to visit is the local library in my town. It's not very big, but it's a quiet and peaceful place. I usually go there on Wednesday afternoons after school. I enjoy sitting by the window and reading different kinds of books, especially adventure stories. The librarians are very friendly and always help me find what I'm looking for. Sometimes, I also use the computers there to do my homework. For me, the library is a wonderful place to escape and learn new things. It's my favorite spot.",
    "chinese_translation": "我非常喜欢去的一个地方是我们镇上的本地图书馆。它不是很大，但却是一个安静祥和的地方。我通常在周三下午放学后去那里。我喜欢坐在窗边读各种各样的书，特别是冒险故事。图书馆员非常友好，总能帮我找到我想要的东西。有时候，我也会用那里的电脑做作业。对我来说，图书馆是一个逃离现实、学习新知识的绝佳去处。它是我最喜欢的地方。"
