    "english_text": "My favourite hobby is playing the guitar. I started learning about a year ago, and I practise every day. I find it very relaxing after a busy day at school. My music teacher is very patient and has taught me a lot of cool songs. I especially enjoy playing pop music and sometimes I try to write my own songs. Next month, I’m going to play in a small concert at my school. I feel a little nervous, but also very excited! It’s a wonderful skill to have and a great way to express myself.",

    "english_text": "Hi Jamie, \n\nThanks for your email. I'm so happy to hear you're coming to visit my city next month! \n\nRegarding your question about what to do, I think you should definitely visit the old castle. It's fascinating and the view from the top is amazing. We could also spend a day at the beach if the weather is nice. In the evenings, we can explore the city centre and try some local restaurants. \n\nLet me know when your train arrives, and I can meet you at the station. \n\nCan't wait to see you! \n\nBest, \n\nChris",
