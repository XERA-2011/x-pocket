    "title": "My Favorite Time of Year",
    "english_text": "My favorite time of year is definitely summer. I love the long, sunny days and the feeling of freedom that comes with them. School is out, so I have plenty of time to spend with my friends and family. We often go to the beach to swim and play volleyball, or we have picnics in the park. The weather is perfect for outdoor activities. Another thing I enjoy is the variety of fresh fruit available, like watermelon and strawberries. For me, summer is all about relaxing, having fun, and making wonderful memories that last all year.",
    "chinese_translation": "我一年中最喜欢的时间绝对是夏天。我喜欢漫长而阳光灿烂的日子以及随之而来的自由感。学校放假了，所以我有很多时间可以和我的朋友和家人在一起。我们经常去海滩游泳、打排球，或者在公园里野餐。天气非常适合户外活动。我喜欢的另一件事是夏天有各种各样的新鲜水果，比如西瓜和草莓。对我来说，夏天就是放松、享受乐趣和创造持续一整年的美好回忆。"
