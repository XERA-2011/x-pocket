    "english_text": "My favourite season is autumn. I love the beautiful colours of the leaves on the trees before they fall. The weather is perfect too. It's not too hot like summer, and it's not too cold like winter. It's cool and comfortable, which is great for walking in the park.\n\nI also enjoy the special feeling of autumn. It's a time for warm drinks like hot chocolate and wearing cozy sweaters. My family and I often go apple picking in the countryside. We make delicious apple pies together afterwards. For me, autumn is the most wonderful time of the year.",

It's called 'The Cozy Corner' and it's a great place to relax.\n\nThe café sells delicious cakes and fresh coffee. Last weekend, I tried their chocolate cake and it was amazing! The atmosphere is very peaceful, with soft music and comfortable chairs. It's a perfect spot for reading or studying.\n\nWe should go there together next Saturday afternoon. Let me know if you are free. I'm sure you will love it!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nChris",
