    "title": "My Favorite Hobby: Painting",
    "english_text": "What’s your favorite way to relax? For me, it’s painting. I started painting two years ago, and it has become my greatest passion. I love using bright colors to create pictures of landscapes and animals. It feels like I’m creating my own little world.\n\nEvery weekend, I spend a few hours in my room with my brushes and paints. It helps me forget all my stress from school. Painting has taught me to be patient and to see the beauty in everything around me. It’s a wonderful hobby that I think everyone should try!",
    "chinese_translation": "你最喜欢的放松方式是什么？对我来说，是绘画。我两年前开始画画，它已经成为我最大的热情所在。我喜欢用鲜艳的色彩来创作风景和动物的图画。感觉就像我在创造自己的小世界。\n\n每个周末，我都会在我的房间里花几个小时用我的画笔和颜料画画。它帮助我忘记所有来自学校的压力。绘画教会了我耐心，也让我看到了周围一切事物的美。这是一个很棒的爱好，我认为每个人都应该尝试一下！"
