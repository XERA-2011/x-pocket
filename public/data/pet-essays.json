    "english_text": "Hi Alex,\n\nThanks so much for your invitation to go to the cinema next weekend. It sounds great!\n\nI'm really sorry, but I don't think I can make it. My cousins are visiting from another city, and we have a big family get-together planned for Saturday. I haven't seen them for ages, so I really can't miss it.\n\nHow about the following weekend? I'm free then. We could catch that new sci-fi film everyone is talking about. Let me know if that works for you.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nChris",

I started about two years ago when my dad gave me his old camera.\n\nI love taking photos of nature, especially animals and flowers. It makes me look at the world more carefully. I spend most of my weekends outdoors, trying to find the perfect shot. Sometimes my friends come with me, and we have a lot of fun together.\n\nPhotography is a wonderful hobby because it's creative and relaxing. It has taught me to be patient and to see the beauty in small things.",
