We'll start at 7 p.m. I'm planning to have lots of great music and my favourite pizza. My brother is also organizing some fun games for us to play in the garden if the weather is good. It will be a great chance to see all our friends together. Please let me know if you can make it. I really hope you can come! Best wishes, Sam.",

    "title": "An Exciting Day",
    "english_text": "Last summer, I had a very exciting day. I went to the beach with my family. While we were walking along the sand, I saw a beautiful, shiny bottle near the water. I picked it up and was amazed to find a small, rolled-up piece of paper inside. It was a message! It said, 'Hello from a friend across the sea. I hope this message finds you well.' I felt like a real explorer who had discovered a secret treasure. It was the most exciting moment of my holiday, and I will never forget it.",
    "chinese_translation": "去年夏天，我度过了非常激动人心的一天。我和家人一起去了海滩。当我们在沙滩上散步时，我看到水边有一个漂亮、闪亮的瓶子。我把它捡起来，惊讶地发现里面有一张卷起来的小纸条。那是一条信息！上面写着：‘来自大洋彼岸朋友的问候。希望你收到这条信息时一切安好。’我感觉自己像一个发现了秘密宝藏的真正探险家。那是我假期中最激动人心的时刻，我永远不会忘记。"
