    "english_text": "My favourite holiday was a trip I took to the mountains last summer with my family. We stayed in a small wooden house, and every morning we woke up to the sound of birds. During the day, we went hiking on different trails. The views from the top of the mountains were amazing! I took lots of photos of the green valleys and beautiful lakes. In the evenings, we cooked dinner together and played card games. It was so peaceful and a great change from the busy city. I felt very relaxed and happy. I hope we can go back again next year.",
    "chinese_translation": "我最喜欢的假期是去年夏天和家人一起去山区旅行。我们住在一个小木屋里，每天早上都在鸟鸣声中醒来。白天，我们在不同的小径上徒步旅行。从山顶看下去的景色棒极了！我拍了很多绿色山谷和美丽湖泊的照片。晚上，我们一起做晚饭，玩纸牌游戏。那里非常宁静，与繁忙的城市形成了鲜明的对比。我感到非常放松和快乐。我希望我们明年能再去一次。"

    "english_text": "Recently, I decided to learn how to cook. I thought it would be a useful skill for the future. I started by watching videos online and reading simple recipes. At first, it was quite difficult. I once put too much salt in a soup and it was terrible! However, I didn't give up. I practiced every weekend, and slowly I got better. Last week, I cooked a full meal for my family, and they all loved it. I was so proud of myself. Learning to cook has been a fun and rewarding experience. Now, I really enjoy making delicious food.",
    "chinese_translation": "最近，我决定学习如何烹饪。我认为这对未来会是一项有用的技能。我从观看在线视频和阅读简单的食谱开始。起初，这相当困难。有一次我汤里放了太多盐，味道糟透了！但是我没有放弃。我每个周末都练习，慢慢地我做得越来越好。上周，我为家人做了一顿丰盛的晚餐，他们都非常喜欢。我为自己感到非常骄傲。学习烹饪是一次有趣且有益的经历。现在，我非常享受制作美味的食物。"
