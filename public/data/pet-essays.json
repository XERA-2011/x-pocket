    "english_text": "Hi Jamie,\n\nThanks for your email! It's great to hear from you. A trip to the cinema sounds like a fantastic idea, and I'd love to join you. I'm free on Saturday afternoon.\n\nYou mentioned a new comedy or an action film. I'd prefer the comedy because I think it's always good to have a laugh. What time does it start? We should meet a little earlier to get good seats and maybe some popcorn.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nI'm really looking forward to it!\n\nBest,\n\nAlex",
    "chinese_translation": "嗨，杰米，\n\n谢谢你的邮件！很高兴收到你的来信。去看电影听起来是个很棒的主意，我很乐意加入。我周六下午有空。\n\n你提到了新的喜剧片或动作片。我更喜欢喜剧片，因为我觉得笑一笑总是好的。电影几点开始？我们应该早点见面，以便占到好座位，或许还可以买些爆米花。\n\n告诉我你的想法。\n\n我真的很期待！\n\n祝好，\n\n亚历克斯"

    "english_text": "My favourite hobby is cooking. I started learning about a year ago by watching videos online. I find it very relaxing and creative. When I'm in the kitchen, I can forget about everything else.\n\nI really enjoy making Italian food, especially pasta. My favourite dish to cook is spaghetti with fresh tomato sauce. It's simple, but it tastes amazing. I often invite my family to try my new recipes, and they usually love them. Cooking is a wonderful skill because you can make delicious food for yourself and the people you care about.",
