    "english_text": "Hi Alex,\nThanks for your email! It's great to hear from you. A trip to the mountains sounds like a fantastic idea. I would love to join you and your family.\nI'm free the weekend after next, from the 15th to the 16th. Would that work for you?\nYou asked about what to bring. I can prepare some sandwiches and snacks for our hike. Should I also bring my own sleeping bag? Please let me know if there is anything else I can help with.\nI'm really looking forward to it!\nBest wishes,\nSam",

    "english_text": "One sunny afternoon, I decided to read my book in the garden. Suddenly, I heard a strange noise coming from behind the big apple tree. I put my book down and walked slowly to see what it was. Peeking behind the trunk, I saw a small, colorful bird with a hurt wing. It looked scared and couldn't fly. I carefully picked it up and took it inside. My mum helped me make a comfortable box for it with water and seeds. We looked after the bird, and after a few days, its wing was better. It was amazing to watch it fly away!",
    "chinese_translation": "一个阳光明媚的下午，我决定在花园里看书。突然，我听到大苹果树后面传来一阵奇怪的声音。我放下书，慢慢走过去看到底是什么。从树干后面偷看，我看到一只带着伤了翅膀的、色彩鲜艳的小鸟。它看起来很害怕，飞不起来。我小心翼翼地把它抱起来带进屋里。我妈妈帮我为它做了一个舒适的盒子，里面放了水和种子。我们照顾着这只小鸟，几天后，它的翅膀好了。看着它飞走的感觉真是太棒了！"
