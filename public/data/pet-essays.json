    "english_text": "My favourite hobby is photography. I received a camera for my birthday last year, and I've been passionate about it ever since. I love capturing beautiful moments, from stunning sunsets to the smiling faces of my friends and family. Every weekend, I try to go to a new place, like a park or a historic street, to find interesting things to photograph. It's a wonderful way to be creative and pay more attention to the world around me. Looking at my photos later always brings back happy memories. It's a hobby that is both relaxing and exciting.",
