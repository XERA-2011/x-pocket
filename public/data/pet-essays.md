## A postcard to your family from your first week at a new school
- 一封你在新学校第一周寄给家人的明信片

**正文**：

Hi everyone,

I'm having a fantastic time at my new school! The first week has been busy but very exciting. My classes are quite interesting, especially the art class, and all the teachers are friendly and helpful.

I've already made a new friend named Alex. We have lunch together every day and he's shown me around the huge campus. The school has a big library and a swimming pool, which is amazing! I was a bit nervous at first, but now I feel really happy here.

Hope you are all well. I miss you!

Lots of love,
Chris

- 大家好，
- 我在新学校过得非常棒！第一周虽然忙碌，但非常令人兴奋。我的课程都很有趣，特别是美术课，而且所有的老师都很友好，乐于助人。
- 我已经交了一个名叫亚历克斯的新朋友。我们每天一起吃午饭，他还带我参观了这个巨大的校园。学校有一个大图书馆和一个游泳池，太棒了！一开始我还有点紧张，但现在我在这里感觉非常开心。
- 希望你们一切都好。想念你们！
- 爱你们的，
- 克里斯

- 一篇关于如何结交新朋友的建议文章

**正文**：

Making new friends can feel difficult, but it doesn't have to be. Here is some simple advice to help you.

First, be yourself. People will like you for who you are. Don't be afraid to show your interests and smile often, as it makes you seem more approachable.

Another good idea is to join clubs or groups. Whether it's a sports team, a book club, or a music group, you will meet people who like the same things as you. Finally, be a good listener. Ask questions and show you are interested in others.

- 结交新朋友可能感觉很难，但其实不必如此。这里有一些简单的建议可以帮助你。
- 首先，做你自己。人们会因为真实的你而喜欢你。不要害怕展示你的兴趣并经常微笑，因为这会让你看起来更容易接近。
- 另一个好主意是加入俱乐部或社团。无论是运动队、读书俱乐部还是音乐小组，你都会遇到和你有相同爱好的人。最后，做一个好的倾听者。多问问题，并表现出你对他人感兴趣。
