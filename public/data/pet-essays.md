# 记叙文/短文

## Write a story beginning: The phone rang at midnight and changed everything.
- 写一个以下列句子开头的故事：午夜电话铃响，一切都改变了。

**正文**：

The phone rang at midnight and changed everything. I was half-asleep, but the caller's frantic voice woke me instantly. It was my friend, Leo. He told me he had found a lost dog in the park with a collar that had my old address on it. I was confused because I hadn't lived there for years.

I rushed to the park and saw a familiar golden retriever. It was Lucky, the dog I had lost five years ago during a family trip. I thought I would never see him again. Tears filled my eyes as he ran towards me, wagging his tail.

- 午夜电话铃响，一切都改变了。我本已半梦半醒，但来电者急切的声音立刻让我清醒了。是我的朋友里奥。他说他在公园里发现了一只走失的狗，项圈上竟然写着我的旧地址。我很困惑，因为我已多年未曾住在那儿。
- 我飞奔到公园，看到了一只熟悉的金毛寻回犬。它是我五年前在一次家庭旅行中走失的狗——“幸运”。我原以为再也见不到它了。当它摇着尾巴朝我跑来时，我的眼眶瞬间充满了泪水。
