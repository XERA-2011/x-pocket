**正文**：

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith,

I am writing to express my sincere gratitude for your kindness during my stay in London. I have safely returned home, but I already miss our time together. Thank you so much for making me feel like a part of your family.

I especially enjoyed our trip to the British Museum and the delicious roast dinner you prepared last Sunday. Your hospitality was incredible, and my English has improved a lot thanks to our daily conversations.

Please keep in touch, and I hope you will visit me in my country one day.

Best wishes,
Alex

## A story about a wish that came true in an unexpected way
- 一个关于愿望以意想不到的方式实现的故事

**正文**：

Last week, I had a huge history exam and I felt really stressed. "I just wish I had one more day to study," I sighed to my friend, Leo. The next morning, I woke up feeling ready for the test, but when I arrived at school, the building was strangely quiet.

It turned out that the school's heating system had broken overnight. Because it was a cold winter day, the headteacher decided to cancel all classes and exams. We were all sent home. I couldn't believe it! I got my wish for an extra day, not because of magic, but because of a broken heater.

- 上周，我有一个很重要的历史考试，我感到压力很大。“我真希望我能多一天时间来学习，”我向我的朋友里奥叹息道。第二天早上，我醒来时感觉已经为考试做好了准备，但当我到达学校时，教学楼里异常安静。
- 原来，学校的供暖系统在一夜之间坏了。因为那是一个寒冷的冬日，校长决定取消所有的课程和考试。我们都被送回了家。我简直不敢相信！我多了一天时间的愿望实现了，不是因为魔法，而是因为一个坏掉的暖气片。
