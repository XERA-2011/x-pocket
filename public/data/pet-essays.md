## An email to a local newspaper giving your opinion on recycling
- 给当地报社的关于你对回收利用看法的邮件

**正文**：

Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my strong support for improving recycling facilities in our town. Recycling is one of the easiest and most effective ways for us to protect the environment. It reduces waste in landfills, saves energy, and conserves natural resources.

Currently, the recycling bins are often full, and the collection service is not frequent enough. I believe the council should invest in more bins and increase collections to twice a week. This would encourage more residents to recycle regularly. Making recycling easier for everyone is a crucial step towards a greener future for our community.

Sincerely,
Alex Chen

- 尊敬的编辑，
- 我写信是为了表达我对改善我们城镇回收设施的强烈支持。回收利用是我们保护环境最简单、最有效的方法之一。它能减少垃圾填埋场的废物，节约能源，并保护自然资源。
- 目前，回收箱常常是满的，而且回收服务也不够频繁。我认为市政会应该投资增设更多的回收箱，并将回收次数增加到每周两次。这将鼓励更多居民定期进行回收。让每个人都能更方便地进行回收，是我们社区迈向更绿色未来的关键一步。
- 此致，
- Alex Chen

**正文**：

Last Tuesday, I was studying for my history exam when my phone buzzed. It was a message from an unknown number. "Is this Leo? I found a wallet with your name on it at the park," it read. I checked my pocket and realised my wallet was gone!

I quickly replied, and we arranged to meet. The person who found it was an elderly woman with a kind smile. I was so grateful that I offered her a reward, but she refused, saying that doing the right thing was its own reward. Her kindness restored my faith in people.

- 上周二，我正在为历史考试复习时，我的手机响了。那是一条来自未知号码的消息。“请问是Leo吗？我在公园里捡到了一个有你名字的钱包，”消息上写着。我检查了我的口袋，发现我的钱包不见了！
- 我迅速回复了消息，我们约好了见面。捡到钱包的是一位笑容和蔼的老妇人。我非常感激，想给她一些报酬，但她拒绝了，说做正确的事本身就是回报。她的善举让我重拾了对人性的信心。
