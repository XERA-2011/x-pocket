## An email to a friend recommending a new restaurant you tried
- 给朋友写一封邮件，推荐你尝试过的一家新餐厅

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

Hope you're doing well. I'm writing to tell you about an amazing new Italian restaurant I tried last night called "The Olive Tree." You would absolutely love it!

The restaurant has a really cozy atmosphere, and the staff are incredibly friendly. I ordered the seafood pasta, and it was the best I've ever had. The prices were quite reasonable too. I know how much you enjoy Italian food, so I thought of you immediately.

We should definitely go together next week. Let me know if you're free.

Best,
Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 希望你一切都好。我写信是想告诉你，我昨晚去了一家超棒的意大利新餐厅，叫做“橄榄树”。你绝对会喜欢的！
- 那家餐厅的气氛非常舒适，员工也极其友好。我点了海鲜意面，那是我吃过的最棒的。价格也很合理。我知道你很喜欢意大利菜，所以立刻就想到了你。
- 我们下周一定要一起去。如果你有空的话，告诉我。
- 祝好，
- 克里斯

## Write a story beginning: The phone rang at midnight and changed everything.
- 写一个以下列句子开头的故事：午夜时分，电话铃响了，一切都改变了。

**正文**：

The phone rang at midnight and changed everything. I was half asleep, but the urgent sound made me jump out of bed. It was my aunt, her voice trembling. "Your grandfather left you something," she said. "A small cottage by the sea. The keys are with me."

The next day, I drove for hours to the coast. The cottage was old but charming, filled with maps and books about the ocean. On a small desk, I found a letter from him. It spoke of a hidden family treasure and a final adventure he had planned for me.

- 午夜时分，电话铃响了，一切都改变了。我本已半梦半醒，但那急促的铃声让我从床上一跃而起。是我姑妈打来的，她的声音在颤抖。“你爷爷给你留了样东西，”她说，“海边的一座小木屋。钥匙在我这里。”
- 第二天，我开了几个小时的车来到海边。那座木屋虽旧但很迷人，里面堆满了地图和关于海洋的书籍。在一张小书桌上，我找到了他留下的一封信。信中提到了一个隐藏的家族宝藏，以及他为我计划的最后一次冒险。
