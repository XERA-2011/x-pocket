**正文**：

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith,

I am writing to thank you for your kindness during my stay in London. I had a wonderful time with your family and really enjoyed practicing my English with you every evening. The food was always delicious, especially the roast dinner you made on Sunday!

Thank you also for taking me to see the Tower of London. It was an amazing day out. I am now back home safely, but I already miss our time together. I hope you will come and visit me in my city one day.

Best wishes,

Alex

- 也谢谢你们带我去参观伦敦塔。那是很棒的一天。我现在已经安全到家了，但我已经开始想念我们在一起的时光。希望有一天你们能来我的城市看我。
- 最好的祝愿，

## Write a story ending: That experience taught me never to judge people too quickly.
- 写一个以下列句子结尾的故事：那次经历教会了我永远不要过快地评判他人。

**正文**：

The new librarian, Mr. Harrison, seemed very strict. He never smiled and always told us to be quiet in a stern voice. One afternoon, I couldn't find a book I needed for my school project. I was about to give up when Mr. Harrison came over. I thought he was going to scold me for making a mess. Instead, he asked gently what I was looking for. After I told him, he spent nearly an hour searching online and in the storeroom. He finally found the book for me. That experience taught me never to judge people too quickly.

- 新来的图书管理员哈里森先生似乎非常严格。他从不微笑，总是用严厉的声音让我们保持安静。
- 一天下午，我找不到学校项目需要的一本书。正当我准备放弃时，哈里森先生走了过来。我以为他会因为我把地方弄得一团糟而责备我。
- 相反，他温柔地问我在找什么。我告诉他之后，他花了将近一个小时在网上和储藏室里查找。他最终为我找到了那本书。那次经历教会了我永远不要过快地评判他人。
