## A story about helping a stranger
- 一个关于帮助陌生人的故事

**正文**：

Last winter, I was walking home when I saw an elderly woman slip on an icy path. Her shopping bags scattered everywhere. I immediately rushed over to help her. She seemed shaken but thankfully wasn't injured.

I helped her stand up and then gathered all her groceries. She told me she lived just around the corner but was scared to walk alone. I offered to accompany her. When we reached her house, she thanked me with a warm smile and offered me a cup of tea. It felt really good to help someone in need.

- 去年冬天，我走在回家的路上，看到一位老妇人在结冰的小路上滑倒了。她的购物袋散落一地。我立刻冲过去帮助她。她看起来吓坏了，但幸运的是没有受伤。
- 我扶她站起来，然后捡起了她所有的杂货。她告诉我她就住在拐角处，但害怕一个人走路。我主动提出陪她回去。当我们到达她家时，她用温暖的微笑感谢我，并请我喝了一杯茶。帮助有需要的人感觉真的很好。
