## An email to a penfriend describing your typical school day
- 给笔友写一封邮件，描述你平常在学校的一天

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

Thanks for your last email! You asked about my typical school day. Well, it's quite busy. I usually get to school at 8 a.m. My first class is Maths, which is challenging but interesting. After that, we have English and History.

We have a lunch break at noon. I eat with my friends in the canteen, and we often chat about our hobbies. In the afternoon, we have Science and PE, which is my favourite subject because I love playing basketball. School finishes at 4 p.m.

What about your school day? Write back soon!

Best wishes,
Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 感谢你上次的邮件！你问我平常在学校是怎样度过的。嗯，日子相当忙碌。我通常在早上8点到校。我的第一节课是数学，虽然有挑战性但很有趣。之后，我们有英语课和历史课。
- 我们在中午有午休时间。我和朋友们在食堂吃饭，我们经常聊各自的爱好。下午，我们有科学课和体育课，体育是我最喜欢的科目，因为我热爱打篮球。学校在下午4点放学。
- 你的校园生活是怎样的呢？期待你的回信！
- 最好的祝愿，
- 克里斯

## A story about helping a stranger
- 一个关于帮助陌生人的故事

**正文**：

Last Saturday, I was walking home from the library when I saw an elderly woman struggling with her heavy shopping bags. She looked very tired, and one of the bags was about to tear. I immediately ran over and asked if she needed any help.

She smiled gratefully and said yes. I took her heaviest bag, and we walked together to her apartment, which was just around the corner. She told me stories about her grandchildren along the way. When we arrived, she thanked me warmly. Helping her made me feel really happy and proud of myself.

- 上周六，我正从图书馆走路回家，看到一位年长的女士正吃力地提着她沉重的购物袋。她看起来非常疲惫，其中一个袋子都快要破了。我立刻跑上前去，问她是否需要帮助。
- 她感激地笑了笑，并答应了。我接过了她最重的那个袋子，我们一起走到了她的公寓，就在街角不远处。一路上，她给我讲了她孙子孙女的故事。当我们到达时，她热情地感谢了我。帮助了她让我感到非常开心和自豪。
