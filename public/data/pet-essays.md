## An email to a penfriend describing your typical school day
- 给笔友写一封邮件，描述你通常在学校的一天

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

Thanks for your last email! You asked about my school day. Well, it's quite busy. I usually get to school at 8 a.m. Classes start at 8:30. My favourite subjects are Science and History. We have four classes in the morning, with a short break in between.

We have lunch at noon, which lasts for an hour. I usually eat with my friends in the canteen. In the afternoon, we have two more classes. School finishes at 4 p.m., but I often stay for the basketball club. It's tiring, but I enjoy it.

Best wishes,
Sam

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 感谢你上次的邮件！你问我在学校的一天是怎样的。嗯，相当忙碌。我通常早上8点到校，8点半开始上课。我最喜欢的科目是科学和历史。我们上午有四节课，中间有一次短暂的休息。
- 我们中午12点吃午饭，有一个小时的时间。我通常和朋友们在食堂吃饭。下午，我们还有两节课。学校下午4点放学，但我经常会为了篮球俱乐部而留下来。虽然很累，但我很享受。
- 最好的祝愿，
- 山姆

## A story about a wish that came true in an unexpected way
- 一个关于愿望以意想不到的方式实现的故事

**正文**：

For my birthday, all I wanted was a puppy. I asked my parents every day, but they always said, "Maybe next year." One rainy afternoon, feeling sad, I whispered my wish to a star I couldn't even see. "I just wish I had a friend," I said.

The next morning, on my way to school, I heard a tiny noise from a box on the street. Inside was a small, shivering kitten with big green eyes. I took him home, and my parents couldn't say no. He wasn't the puppy I wished for, but he became my best friend.

- 我生日的时候，最想要的就是一只小狗。我每天都问父母，但他们总是说：“也许明年吧。”一个下雨的午后，我感到很难过，对着一颗我根本看不见的星星许了愿。我说：“我只希望能有个朋友。”
- 第二天早上，在上学的路上，我听到街边一个盒子里传来微弱的声音。里面是一只身体颤抖、长着绿色大眼睛的小猫。我把它带回了家，我的父母没能拒绝。它不是我许愿想要的小狗，却成了我最好的朋友。
