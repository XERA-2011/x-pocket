## A postcard inviting your cousin to stay with you for a weekend
- [一张邀请你表兄/妹与你共度周末的明信片]

**正文**：

Hi Sam,

How are things going? I hope you're doing well.

I'm writing to ask if you'd like to come and stay with me for a weekend next month. It feels like ages since we last saw each other! There's a new science museum that has just opened here, and I thought we could go and check it out. We could also go cycling in the park on Sunday if the weather is nice.

My parents would be really happy to see you as well. Let me know if you think you can make it.

Best wishes,
Alex

## An article about the importance of protecting the environment
- [一篇关于保护环境重要性的文章]

**正文**：

Our planet is facing serious environmental problems, and it is more important than ever to take action. Protecting our environment means ensuring we have clean air to breathe and fresh water to drink. Pollution from traffic and industry harms our health, while plastic waste is choking our oceans and killing marine animals.

Everyone can contribute to making a positive change. Simple actions, such as recycling paper and plastic, saving electricity at home, and using public transport can make a huge difference. By working together, we can protect our world for ourselves and for future generations.

- [我们的星球正面临着严重的环境问题，采取行动比以往任何时候都更加重要。保护我们的环境意味着确保我们有干净的空气来呼吸，有纯净的水来饮用。交通和工业造成的污染损害我们的健康，而塑料垃圾正使我们的海洋窒息，并杀死海洋动物。]
- [每个人都可以为创造积极的改变做出贡献。一些简单的行动，例如回收纸张和塑料、在家节约用电以及使用公共交通工具，都能带来巨大的改变。通过共同努力，我们可以为我们自己以及子孙后代保护我们的世界。]
