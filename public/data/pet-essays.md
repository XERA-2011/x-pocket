## An email giving directions to your new house
- 一封指引前往你新家的邮件

**正文**:

Hi Alex,

I'm so excited for you to visit my new house this Saturday! It's quite easy to find. From the city centre, take the number 15 bus and get off at the stop next to the public library on Maple Street.

Once you're off the bus, walk straight ahead and take the second right turn onto Oak Avenue. You'll see a small park on your left. My house is number 23, right opposite the park. It's the one with a bright red door. If you have any trouble finding it, just give me a call.

See you soon!

Best,
Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 很高兴你这周六能来我的新家做客！这里很好找。从市中心乘坐15路公交车，在枫树街公共图书馆旁的车站下车。
- 下车后，直走，在第二个路口右转进入橡树大道。你会看到左手边有一个小公园。我家是23号，就在公园的正对面，是那栋有着鲜红色大门的房子。如果找不到，随时给我打电话。
- 期待很快见到你！
- 此致，
- 克里斯

## Write a story about an unexpected message you received
- 写一个关于你收到的意外消息的故事

**正文**:

Last Friday, I was studying for my history exam when my phone suddenly lit up. It was a message from an unknown number. Normally, I would ignore it, but I decided to check it. The message said, "Look outside your window now."

Feeling a bit curious and nervous, I walked to the window and pulled back the curtain. To my complete surprise, my cousin, who lives in another country, was standing on the street below, waving at me with a huge smile. I hadn't seen him in over three years! It was the best surprise ever.

- 上周五，我正在为历史考试复习，手机屏幕突然亮了。是一条来自陌生号码的消息。通常我会忽略它，但这次我决定看一看。消息上写着：“现在看看你的窗外。”
- 我带着一丝好奇和紧张，走到窗前拉开窗帘。令我完全没想到的是，我住国外的表哥正站在楼下的街上，带着灿烂的笑容向我挥手。我已经三年多没见过他了！这是我有史以来收到的最棒的惊喜。
