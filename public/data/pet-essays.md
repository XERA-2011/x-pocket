## An email apologizing to a friend for missing their party
- 一封因错过朋友聚会而向其致歉的邮件

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

I’m writing to say I’m really sorry that I missed your birthday party last Saturday. I was so excited about it, but I started feeling unwell that afternoon. I had a high temperature and a headache, so my mum insisted I stay in bed.

I was so disappointed to miss out on the celebration. I heard it was a fantastic evening! Did everyone enjoy the barbecue? I hope you got lots of great presents.

I feel much better now and would love to hear all about it. Let’s meet up for coffee next week.

Best,
Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 我写信是想告诉你，我非常抱歉错过了上周六你的生日聚会。我本来对此充满期待，但那天下午我开始感到不舒服。我发高烧还头痛，所以我妈妈坚持要我卧床休息。
- 错过了这次庆祝活动，我感到非常失望。我听说那是一个精彩的夜晚！大家是不是都很喜欢烧烤？希望你收到了很多很棒的礼物。
- 我现在感觉好多了，很想听听聚会的所有事情。我们下周找个时间喝杯咖啡见个面吧。
- 祝好，
- 克里斯

## An article about why young people should volunteer in their community
- 一篇关于年轻人为何应该在社区做志愿者的文章

**正文**：

Volunteering is a fantastic way for young people to contribute to their community. It offers a unique opportunity to make a real difference while also developing important life skills.

When you volunteer, you can learn teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills that are valuable for your future career. For example, helping at a local animal shelter or organizing a charity event teaches responsibility. It also allows you to meet new people from different backgrounds and understand more about the world around you.

Giving your time to help others brings a great sense of achievement and happiness. It strengthens our communities and makes them better places to live. So, why not find a local group and get involved?

- 志愿服务是年轻人为社区做出贡献的绝佳方式。它提供了一个独特的机会，让你在真正改变社区的同时，也能发展重要的生活技能。
- 当你做志愿者时，你可以学到对未来职业生涯非常有价值的团队合作、沟通和解决问题的能力。例如，在当地的动物收容所帮忙或组织慈善活动可以教会你责任感。它还能让你结识来自不同背景的新朋友，更多地了解你周围的世界。
- 奉献自己的时间去帮助他人会带来巨大的成就感和幸福感。它能巩固我们的社区，让它们成为更美好的居住地。那么，为什么不找一个本地团体并参与其中呢？
