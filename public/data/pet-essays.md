# 记叙文/短文

## Write a story that begins: When I opened the old box, I found something incredible inside.
- 写一个以下列句子开头的故事：当我打开那个旧盒子时，我在里面发现了一件不可思议的东西。

**正文**:

When I opened the old box, I found something incredible inside. It was a small, silver compass that wasn't pointing north. Instead, its needle was spinning wildly before it locked onto a picture of my lost cat, Whiskers, on my desk. I thought it was broken, but when I picked it up, the needle pointed straight towards the front door.

Curious, I followed its direction out of the house and down the street. It led me to the old park. There, sleeping under a bench, was Whiskers! The compass had led me straight to him.

- 当我打开那个旧盒子时，我在里面发现了一件不可思议的东西。那是一个小小的银色罗盘，但它并不指向北方。相反，它的指针疯狂地旋转，然后锁定了我书桌上一张我丢失的猫“晶晶”的照片。我以为它坏了，但当我拿起它时，指针直直地指向了前门。
- 
- 出于好奇，我跟着它的指引走出了房子，沿着街道前行。它把我带到了旧公园。在那里，一只猫正睡在长凳下，是晶晶！这个罗盘直接把我带到了他身边。
