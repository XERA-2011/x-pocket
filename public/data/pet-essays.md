Hi Alex,

Hope you're doing well. I'm writing to let you know that I'm organizing a small party at my place next Saturday, August 23rd. It will start at around 6 p.m.

I'm planning a movie night theme. We'll have lots of popcorn, snacks, and drinks. I've got a few great comedies that I think everyone will enjoy. It will be a relaxed and fun evening, and a great chance for all of us to catch up.

Please let me know if you can come by this Thursday so I can finalize the arrangements. I really hope you can make it!

Best,

Chris

## A story about a memorable journey you took with your family
- 一个关于你和家人的一次难忘旅行的故事

**正文**：

One of my most memorable journeys was a trip to the mountains with my family last summer. We stayed in a small wooden cabin surrounded by tall pine trees. The air was so fresh and clean.

During the day, we went hiking on the mountain trails. I remember the beautiful views from the top and the sound of birds singing everywhere. In the evenings, we sat around a campfire, telling stories and looking at the stars. The sky was so clear that we could see the Milky Way. It was a simple trip, but being close to nature and spending quality time with my family made it truly unforgettable.

- 我最难忘的旅行之一是去年夏天和家人一起去的山区之旅。我们住在一个被高大松树环绕的小木屋里。那里的空气是如此清新和洁净。
- 白天，我们在山间小径上徒步。我记得从山顶看到的壮丽景色和随处可闻的鸟鸣声。到了晚上，我们围坐在篝火旁，讲着故事，仰望星空。天空是如此清澈，我们甚至能看到银河。那是一次简单的旅行，但亲近自然以及与家人共度的美好时光让它变得真正难以忘怀。
