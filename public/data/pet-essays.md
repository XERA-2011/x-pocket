## An email to a local newspaper giving your opinion on recycling
- 给当地报纸写一封邮件，谈谈你对回收利用的看法

**正文**：

Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on recycling in our town. I believe recycling is extremely important for protecting our environment, but I feel that not enough is being done to encourage residents to participate.

While many households do separate their waste, the public recycling bins in the town centre are often full or difficult to find. To improve this, I suggest the council install more bins and provide clearer information about what can be recycled. A campaign in your newspaper could also raise awareness.

I hope you will consider this issue.

Yours faithfully,
Alex Chen

- 尊敬的编辑：
- 我写信是为了表达我对我们城镇回收利用情况的看法。我认为回收利用对于保护我们的环境至关重要，但我感觉我们为鼓励居民参与所做的工作还不够。
- 尽管许多家庭确实会进行垃圾分类，但市中心的公共回收箱却常常满溢或难以找到。为了改善这一状况，我建议市政会增设更多的回收箱，并提供更清晰的指引，说明哪些物品可以回收。在贵报上发起一场宣传活动也能提高大家的意识。
- 希望您能考虑这个问题。
- 忠实的读者，
- Alex Chen

## Write a story beginning: The phone rang at midnight and changed everything.
- 写一个以下列句子开头的故事：午夜时分，电话铃响了，一切都改变了。

**正文**：

The phone rang at midnight and changed everything. I was half asleep and grabbed it, annoyed. "Hello?" I mumbled. It was my older sister, Clara, who lived in Australia. Her voice was trembling with excitement. "I've won! I've won the lottery!" she shouted.

I sat up, suddenly wide awake. She explained that she had bought a ticket online and had just won a million dollars. She wanted to share it with the family. She was planning to fly home next week to celebrate with us. I couldn't believe it. My ordinary life felt extraordinary.

- 午夜时分，电话铃响了，一切都改变了。我半梦半醒，不耐烦地抓起电话。“喂？”我咕哝道。是住在我澳大利亚的姐姐克拉拉。她的声音因激动而颤抖。“我中奖了！我中彩票了！”她喊道。
- 我一下子坐了起来，瞬间完全清醒了。她解释说她在网上买了一张彩票，刚刚赢得了一百万美元。她想和家人分享这笔钱。她计划下周飞回家和我们一起庆祝。我简直不敢相信。我平凡的生活瞬间变得非凡起来。
