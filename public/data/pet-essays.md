- 一封感谢信，致帮助你学习英语的人

**正文**：

Dear Alex,

I hope you're doing well. I'm writing to express my sincere gratitude for your help with my English studies. When I first started, I struggled a lot with speaking and grammar, but your patient guidance made a huge difference.

The weekly conversation practice we had was incredibly helpful. You always corrected my mistakes kindly and encouraged me to speak more confidently. Thanks to you, my English has improved so much that I recently passed my exam with a great score!

I really appreciate all the time and effort you dedicated to helping me. Thank you again for everything!

Best regards,

Chris

## Write a story ending: That experience taught me never to judge people too quickly.
- 写一个以下列句子结尾的故事：那次经历教会了我永远不要过早地对人下判断。

**正文**：

Last winter, a new neighbor, Mr. Harrison, moved in next door. He was an old man who always wore a grumpy expression and never said hello. My friends and I thought he was unfriendly and probably mean. We often saw him working in his garden, looking serious.

One afternoon, my cat, Leo, climbed a tall tree and was too scared to come down. My parents weren't home. I didn't know what to do. Suddenly, Mr. Harrison appeared with a ladder. He calmly climbed up and gently brought Leo back to me. He even smiled. That experience taught me never to judge people too quickly.

- 去年冬天，一位名叫哈里森先生的新邻居搬到了隔壁。他是一位老人，总是板着脸，从不打招呼。我和朋友们都觉得他很不友好，可能还很刻薄。我们经常看到他在花园里干活，表情严肃。
- 一天下午，我的猫里奥爬上了一棵高树，吓得不敢下来。我父母又不在家。我不知所措。突然，哈里森先生拿着梯子出现了。他镇定地爬上去，温柔地把里奥抱下来还给了我。他甚至还笑了。那次经历教会了我永远不要过早地对人下判断。
