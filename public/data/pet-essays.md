## An email to your English teacher explaining why you missed a class
- 给你的英语老师写一封邮件，解释你为什么缺课

**正文**：

Dear Mr. Smith,

I am writing to apologize for missing your English class yesterday, August 25th. I had a sudden dental appointment that I could not reschedule. I felt very sorry to miss the lesson on narrative tenses as I know it is an important topic.

Could you please let me know what was covered in the class and if there was any homework assigned? I have already borrowed the notes from my classmate, Jane, and I will make sure to catch up on all the material before our next lesson.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

- 我写这封信是为了对我昨天（8月25日）缺席您的英语课表示歉意。我有一个突然的牙医预约，无法改期。错过了关于叙事时态的那节课，我感到非常遗憾，因为我知道这是一个重要的话题。
- 请问您能告诉我课上讲了哪些内容，以及是否布置了家庭作业吗？我已经向同学简借了笔记，并且我保证会在下节课前把所有错过的材料都补上。
- 感谢您的理解。

## A story about a memorable journey you took with your family
- 一个关于你和家人的一次难忘旅程的故事

**正文**：

I will never forget the trip my family and I took to the mountains last summer. We rented a small wooden cabin by a beautiful, clear lake. Every morning, we woke up to the sound of birds singing. My father taught me how to fish, and although I didn't catch anything, I loved spending that quiet time with him.

One afternoon, we went hiking and got caught in a light rain shower. Instead of being upset, we laughed and ran back to our cabin, feeling like adventurers. We spent the evening playing board games and drinking hot chocolate. It was a simple trip, but it was perfect because we were all together.

- 我永远不会忘记去年夏天我和家人去山区的那次旅行。我们在一个美丽清澈的湖边租了一间小木屋。每天早上，我们都在鸟儿的歌声中醒来。我父亲教我如何钓鱼，虽然我什么也没钓到，但我很享受和他在一起的那段安静时光。
- 一天下午，我们去远足，遇到了一场小阵雨。我们没有因此而沮-丧，反而大笑着跑回小屋，感觉自己就像探险家一样。那天晚上，我们玩着棋盘游戏，喝着热巧克力。那是一次简单的旅行，但却很完美，因为我们都在一起。
