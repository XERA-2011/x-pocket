## A postcard to your family from your first week at a new school
- 来自新学校第一周给你家人的明信片

**正文**：

Hi everyone,

I'm having a fantastic time at my new school! It's much bigger than my old one, and the campus is beautiful. I was a bit nervous at first, but I've already made some lovely friends. My roommate, Sarah, is very kind and has been showing me around.

The teachers are really supportive, and the lessons are more interesting than I expected, especially the art class. I'm learning so much already. I miss you all, but I'm settling in well. Can't wait to tell you more about it soon!

Lots of love,
Alex

- 大家好，
- 我在新学校过得非常棒！这里比我以前的学校大得多，校园也很美。起初我有点紧张，但我已经交到了一些很棒的朋友。我的室友莎拉人很好，一直带我四处熟悉环境。
- 老师们都非常支持我，课程也比我想象的要有趣，尤其是美术课。我已经学到了很多东西。我很想念你们，但我适应得很好。等不及很快和你们分享更多事情！
- 爱你们的，
- 亚历克斯

## Write a story beginning: The phone rang at midnight and changed everything.
- 写一个以下列句子开头的故事：午夜时分，电话铃响了，一切都改变了。

**正文**：

The phone rang at midnight and changed everything. I groggily reached for it, wondering who would call at such an hour. A frantic voice on the other end shouted, "It's real! The map we found in grandma's attic... it leads to real treasure!" It was my cousin, Leo.

I was skeptical, but his excitement was contagious. The next morning, instead of going to my boring office job, I was on a train to the coast with a backpack and an old, mysterious map. My predictable life was over, replaced by an unexpected adventure.

- 午夜时分，电话铃响了，一切都改变了。我睡眼惺忪地伸手去拿电话，心想谁会这么晚打电话来。电话那头一个狂热的声音喊道：“是真的！我们在奶奶阁楼里找到的那张地图……它指向了真正的宝藏！” 是我的表哥里奥。
- 我本持怀疑态度，但他的兴奋之情很有感染力。第二天早上，我没有去我那份无聊的办公室工作，而是背着背包，带着一张古老而神秘的地图，坐上了去往海岸的火车。我那可预见的生活结束了，取而代之的是一场意想不到的冒险。
