- 一封致语言学校询问英语课程与价格的邮件

**正文**：

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to ask for information about the English courses at your school. I am interested in improving my speaking and writing skills, and I believe my current level is intermediate.

Could you please send me details about your intermediate-level courses? I would like to know about the class sizes and the schedule, as I am only available on weekday evenings. Furthermore, could you provide information on the course fees and any available discounts for new students?

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours faithfully,
Chris Wang

- 我写信是为了询问贵校的英语课程信息。我对提升自己的口语和写作能力很感兴趣，目前我的水平是中级。
- 您能否寄给我关于中级课程的详细资料？我想了解班级人数和课程安排，因为我只有工作日的晚上有空。
- 此外，您能否提供关于课程费用以及新生是否有任何折扣的信息？
- 期待您的早日回复。

## An article reviewing a movie that all teenagers should watch
- 一篇评论所有青少年都该看的电影的文章

**正文**：

If you are looking for a film that is both entertaining and inspiring, you must watch "Hidden Figures". The movie tells the true story of three brilliant African-American women who worked at NASA during the 1960s. They were the brains behind one of the greatest operations in history: the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit.

This film is a powerful reminder that intelligence and determination can overcome any obstacle, including prejudice. The story is incredibly moving, and the acting is superb. It teaches us about courage, friendship, and the importance of fighting for your dreams. It’s a perfect movie for teenagers.

- 如果你正在寻找一部既有趣又鼓舞人心的电影，你一定要看《隐藏人物》。
- 这部电影讲述了三位杰出的非裔美国女性在20世纪60年代为NASA工作的真实故事。她们是史上最伟大行动之一——宇航员约翰·格伦进入轨道的幕后功臣。
- 这部电影有力地提醒我们，智慧和决心可以战胜任何障碍，包括偏见。故事情节极其感人，演员的表演也十分精湛。它教会我们勇气、友谊以及为梦想奋斗的重要性。这对青少年来说是一部完美的电影。
