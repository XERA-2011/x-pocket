**正文**：

Hi Alex,

I'm so excited for you to come over this Saturday! Here are the directions to my place.

Take the number 15 bus from the city centre and get off at the Oakwood stop, which is right opposite a large supermarket. Walk straight down Maple Street for about five minutes until you see a small park on your left. My house is the blue one right after the park, number 23. You can't miss it! If you get lost, just give me a call.

Can't wait to see you!

Best,
Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 你这周六能来我真的太激动了！这是来我家的路线。
- 从市中心乘坐15路公交车，在奥克伍德站下车，车站正对着一个大型超市。沿着枫树街直走大约五分钟，直到你看到左边有一个小公园。我的房子是公园后面的那栋蓝色建筑，门牌号是23。你不会错过的！如果迷路了，就给我打电话。
- 等不及要见你了！
- 祝好，
- 克里斯

## Write a story about a funny misunderstanding
- 写一个关于有趣误会的故事

**正文**：

Last week, I went to a café to meet my friend, Sarah. I saw a woman with the same red coat and blonde hair as her, sitting at a table near the window. I walked up behind her and shouted, "Guess who!" She turned around, and it wasn't Sarah at all. It was a complete stranger who looked very surprised. I felt my face turn bright red and apologized immediately. Just then, the real Sarah walked in and saw the whole thing. We couldn't stop laughing about it for the rest of the day.

- 上周，我去一家咖啡馆见我的朋友莎拉。我看到一位穿着和她一样的红色外套、留着金色头发的女士坐在靠窗的桌子旁。我走到她身后，大喊一声：“猜猜我是谁！”她转过身来，但根本不是莎拉。那是一个看起来非常惊讶的陌生人。我感觉自己的脸瞬间涨得通红，并立刻道了歉。就在那时，真正的莎拉走了进来，目睹了整个过程。那天剩下的时间里，我们俩一直为这件事笑个不停。
