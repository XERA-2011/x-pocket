## An email giving directions to your new house
- 一封告知新家路线的邮件

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

I'm so excited for you to visit my new house this Saturday! Here are the directions.

Take the number 15 bus from the city center and get off at the Oak Street stop. Walk straight ahead for about two minutes until you see a large supermarket. My road, Pine Close, is the first turning on the left after the supermarket. Walk down Pine Close, and my house is number 22. It's the one with a bright blue door, so you can't miss it!

Let me know if you have any trouble finding it.

Best,
Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 很高兴你这周六能来我的新家！这是路线。
- 从市中心乘坐15路公交车，在橡树街站下车。然后一直往前走大约两分钟，直到你看到一个大型超市。我的路，松树巷，是超市后的第一个左转弯。沿着松树巷走，我的房子是22号。就是那个有着亮蓝色门的房子，你不会错过的！
- 如果你找不到，随时告诉我。
- 祝好，
- 克里斯

## An article about a traditional celebration in your country
- 一篇关于你国家传统节日的文章

**正文**：

The Spring Festival is the most important traditional celebration in my country. It usually lasts for about fifteen days and marks the beginning of the lunar new year.

Before the festival, families clean their homes thoroughly to sweep away any bad luck. On New Year's Eve, everyone gathers for a big family dinner, which is full of delicious, symbolic foods like dumplings and fish. People wear new clothes, often in red, as it represents happiness and good fortune. Children receive red envelopes with money inside for good luck. It's a wonderful time filled with joy and family reunion.

- 春节是我国最重要的传统节日。它通常持续约十五天，标志着农历新年的开始。
- 节前，家家户户都会彻底打扫卫生，以扫除任何坏运气。除夕夜，大家会团聚在一起享用丰盛的年夜饭，餐桌上摆满了饺子和鱼等美味又富有象征意义的食物。人们会穿上新衣，通常是红色的，因为它代表着幸福和好运。孩子们会收到装有压岁钱的红包，以求好运。这是一个充满欢乐和家庭团聚的美好时光。
