## Write a story about a surprising event that happened at school
- 写一个在学校发生的惊喜事件的故事

**正文**：

It was a normal Tuesday at school, and everyone was feeling bored during the morning assembly. Our headmaster, Mr. Harrison, was giving a long speech about school rules. Suddenly, the fire alarm went off. We all calmly walked out to the playground, thinking it was just another drill.

However, when we got outside, we saw a huge hot air balloon landing on the football field! Mr. Harrison smiled and announced that our school had won a national science competition, and the prize was a ride for everyone. We were all speechless, then we started cheering. It was the most exciting day at school ever.

- 那是学校里一个普通的星期二，在早会上每个人都感到很无聊。我们的校长哈里森先生正在就学校规定发表长篇大论。突然，火警响了。我们都平静地走到操场上，以为这又是一次演习。
- 然而，当我们到达外面时，我们看到一个巨大的热气球正在足球场上降落！哈里森先生微笑着宣布，我们学校赢得了一项全国科学竞赛，奖品是让每个人都乘坐一次。我们都惊讶得说不出话来，然后开始欢呼。这是有史以来在学校里最激动人心的一天。
