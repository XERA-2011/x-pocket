## An email inviting your cousin to visit you during the holidays
- 一封邀请表兄/妹假期来访的邮件

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

How are you doing? The summer holiday is just around the corner, and I was thinking it would be great if you could come and visit me. I know you haven't been to my city before, and there's so much for us to do!

There's a new science museum that just opened downtown which looks amazing. We could also spend a day at the beach if the weather is nice. Plus, my mom promised to make her famous barbecue for us. It would be so much fun to finally hang out again after such a long time.

Let me know if you can make it!

Best,
Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 你最近怎么样？暑假马上就要到了，我在想，如果你能来我这儿玩就太好了。我知道你以前没来过我的城市，我们有很多事可以一起做！
- 市中心新开了一家科技博物馆，看起来非常棒。如果天气好的话，我们还可以在海滩上玩一天。而且，我妈妈答应为我们做她拿手的烤肉。这么久没见，我们能再次聚在一起一定会非常有趣。
- 如果你能来的话，请告诉我！
- 祝好，
- 克里斯

## An article reviewing a movie that all teenagers should watch
- 一篇推荐所有青少年都应观看的电影的影评

**正文**：

**A Film That Speaks to You: "The Edge of Seventeen"**

Are you looking for a movie that truly understands the challenges of being a teenager? If so, you must watch "The Edge of Seventeen." The film tells the story of Nadine, a high school student who feels awkward and lonely, especially after her best friend starts dating her popular older brother.

The movie is brilliant because it's both hilarious and incredibly honest. It perfectly captures the feeling that everything is the end of the world, a common emotion for many teenagers. It teaches us that it's okay not to be perfect and that everyone is struggling with their own problems. I highly recommend it.

- **一部与你对话的电影：《成长边缘》**
- 你是否在寻找一部真正理解青少年时期挑战的电影？如果是这样，你一定要看《成长边缘》。这部电影讲述了高中生娜丁的故事，她总感觉自己笨拙又孤独，尤其是在她最好的朋友开始和她受欢迎的哥哥约会之后。
- 这部电影非常出色，因为它既搞笑又异常真实。它完美地捕捉到了那种感觉一切都像是世界末日的情绪，这是许多青少年共有的感受。它告诉我们，不完美也没关系，每个人都在与自己的问题作斗争。我强烈推荐这部电影。
