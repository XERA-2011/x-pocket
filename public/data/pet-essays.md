Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith,

I'm writing to express my sincere gratitude for your kindness during my stay in London. I'm now safely back home, but I already miss our evening chats and the delicious meals you prepared. You made me feel like a real member of your family.

Thank you for helping me with my English and showing me around the city. The trip to the British Museum was a highlight for me. Your hospitality was incredible, and it made my experience unforgettable. I hope you will visit me in China one day.

Best wishes,
Li Hua

- 我写这封信是为了表达在我伦敦逗留期间您们给予我善待的诚挚感谢。如今我已平安返家，但我已经开始怀念我们的夜谈和您们准备的美味佳肴。您们让我感觉自己就像是这个家庭的真正一员。
- 感谢您们帮助我练习英语并带我游览城市。参观大英博物馆的经历对我来说是一大亮点。您们的盛情款待令人难忘，让我的这次经历变得难以忘怀。我希望有一天您们能来中国拜访我。

**正文**：

Last Saturday, I saw my friend Tom leaving a jewelry shop with a beautiful necklace. I knew his girlfriend, Sarah, had a birthday coming up, but I had also heard they were arguing. Later, I saw him give the necklace to another girl in a café. I was shocked and thought he was being unfaithful.

Feeling upset for Sarah, I almost called her. However, I decided to ask Tom first. He laughed and explained the girl was his cousin, who was helping him choose the perfect birthday gift for Sarah. The next day, Sarah was overjoyed with her present, and I was relieved I hadn't jumped to the wrong conclusion.

- 上周六，我看到我的朋友汤姆带着一条漂亮的项链走出一家珠宝店。我知道他的女朋友莎拉的生日快到了，但我也听说他们最近在吵架。之后，我看到他在一家咖啡馆里把项链给了另一个女孩。我感到震惊，以为他背叛了感情。
- 我为莎拉感到难过，差点就打电话给她了。然而，我决定先问问汤姆。他笑着解释说，那个女孩是他的表妹，正在帮他为莎拉挑选完美的生日礼物。第二天，莎拉对她的礼物欣喜若狂，而我也因为自己没有草率地得出错误结论而松了一口气。
