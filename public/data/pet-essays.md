## An email to a shop to complain about a product you bought
- 给商店写一封电子邮件，投诉你购买的产品

**正文**：

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to complain about a pair of headphones I bought from your online store last week, on August 13th. The order number is XZ5678.

When they arrived, I was very excited. However, after only two days of use, the sound in the right earphone stopped working completely. I was very disappointed because they were advertised as a high-quality product.

I have attached a copy of my receipt. I would like a full refund for the faulty product. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours faithfully,

Chris Wong

- 尊敬的先生或女士：
- 我写信是为了投诉我上周（8月13日）从你们网店购买的一副耳机，订单号是XZ5678。
- 收到耳机时我非常兴奋。然而，仅仅使用了两天，右边耳机的声音就完全消失了。我感到非常失望，因为广告宣称这是一款高品质产品。
- 我附上了收据的复印件。我希望能为这个有问题的产品获得全额退款。期待您的尽快回复。
- 此致，
- Chris Wong

## Write a story that ends with: 'I would never forget that day.'
- 写一个以“我永远不会忘记那一天”结尾的故事。

**正文**：

Last summer, my family and I went camping near a beautiful lake. One afternoon, while my parents were preparing dinner, my little brother, Leo, wandered off into the woods. When we realised he was gone, we started to panic. We shouted his name, but there was no answer. The sun began to set, and we were all terrified. Just as I was losing hope, I heard a small cry. I followed the sound and found Leo sitting under a big tree, crying. He was safe! The relief I felt was overwhelming. I would never forget that day.

- 去年夏天，我和家人去一个美丽的湖边露营。一天下午，当我父母正在准备晚餐时，我的弟弟 Leo 独自走进了森林。
- 当我们发现他不见了的时候，我们开始恐慌起来。我们大声呼喊他的名字，但没有回应。太阳开始下山，我们都吓坏了。
- 就在我快要失去希望的时候，我听到了微弱的哭声。我循着声音找去，发现 Leo 正坐在一棵大树下哭泣。他安然无恙！我感到的那种宽慰是难以言表的。我永远不会忘记那一天。
