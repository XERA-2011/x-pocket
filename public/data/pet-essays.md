## An email to your headteacher suggesting a new school club
- 给校长写一封建议成立新学校社团的邮件

**正文**：

Dear Mr. Harrison,

My name is Tom White from Class 9B. I am writing to suggest a new school club: a Creative Writing Club.

Many students love writing stories and poems, but we don't have a club for it. This club would be a great place for us to share our work, get feedback, and improve our skills. We could hold weekly meetings to discuss different writing styles and even invite local authors to speak. I believe this would help students express themselves better and build their confidence.

Thank you for considering my suggestion.

Yours sincerely,

Tom White

- 尊敬的哈里森先生，
- 我是九年级B班的汤姆·怀特。我写信是为了建议成立一个新的学校社团：创意写作社。
- 许多学生都喜欢写故事和诗歌，但我们没有一个专门的社团。这个社团将是一个很棒的平台，让我们分享作品、获得反馈并提升技巧。我们可以每周开会讨论不同的写作风格，甚至可以邀请本地作家来做讲座。我相信这能帮助学生更好地表达自我，建立自信。
- 感谢您考虑我的建议。
- 此致，
- 汤姆·怀特

**正文**：

Last Saturday, I saw my best friend, Lily, walking on the other side of the street. I waved and shouted her name, but she just looked at me and walked away quickly. I was so hurt and confused. I thought she was angry with me, but I didn't know why. I spent the whole weekend feeling sad.

On Monday, Lily ran up to me at school. "I'm so sorry!" she said. "I lost my glasses on Friday and couldn't see anything! My mum just got me a new pair this morning." I started laughing, completely relieved.

- 上周六，我看到我最好的朋友莉莉在街对面走。我向她挥手并喊了她的名字，但她只是看了我一眼就匆匆走开了。我感到既伤心又困惑。我以为她生我的气了，却不知道为什么。我整个周末都很难过。
- 星期一，莉莉在学校里向我跑来。“太对不起了！”她说，“我周五把眼镜弄丢了，什么都看不清！我妈妈今天早上才刚给我配了副新的。”我如释重负，大笑了起来。
