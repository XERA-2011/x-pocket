**正文**：

Hi Sam,

I'm finally here in Brighton! The city is amazing, full of life and right by the sea. The weather has been surprisingly sunny, so I've spent a lot of time walking along the beach.

I've already visited the Royal Pavilion, which was incredible. The architecture is so unique. I'm starting my new job next week, and I'm a bit nervous but also very excited. There are so many cool shops and cafes to explore.

Hope you can come and visit soon!

Best,
Alex

- 嗨，萨姆，
- 我终于到布莱顿了！这座城市太棒了，充满活力，而且就在海边。天气出奇地晴朗，所以我花了很多时间在海滩上散步。
- 我已经参观了皇家穹顶宫，那里简直不可思议。建筑风格非常独特。我下周就要开始新工作了，有点紧张，但也很兴奋。这里还有很多很酷的商店和咖啡馆等着我去探索。
- 希望你很快能来玩！
- 祝好，

## An article describing your favorite festival and why you enjoy it
- 一篇描述你最喜欢的节日以及你为什么喜欢它的文章

**正文**：

My favourite festival of the year is Christmas. For me, it's not just about the presents, but about the special atmosphere and spending time with family.

Every year, my family and I decorate a big Christmas tree together with colourful lights and shiny baubles. The whole house smells of pine and gingerbread. On Christmas Day, we have a huge dinner with roast turkey and lots of delicious side dishes. Afterwards, we play board games and watch classic Christmas films. It’s a time of warmth, laughter, and creating precious memories. I love it because it brings everyone closer.

- 我一年中最喜欢的节日是圣诞节。对我来说，它不仅仅关乎礼物，更在于那独特的氛围和与家人共度的时光。
- 每年，我和家人都会一起用五彩的灯和闪亮的装饰球来装点一棵大大的圣诞树。整个屋子都弥漫着松树和姜饼的香味。
- 圣诞节当天，我们会享用一顿丰盛的晚餐，有烤火鸡和许多美味的配菜。晚饭后，我们玩棋盘游戏，看经典的圣诞电影。这是一段充满温暖、欢笑和创造珍贵回忆的时光。我喜欢它，因为它让每个人都更加亲近。
