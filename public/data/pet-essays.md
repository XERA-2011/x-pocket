Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to ask for information about the English courses at your school. I am interested in improving my speaking and writing skills, and I would like to know what options are available.

Could you please send me details about your intensive and part-time courses? I would also like to know the start dates and the prices. I am an intermediate-level student, so any information on placement tests would be helpful too.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

## A story about a wish that came true in an unexpected way
- 一个以意想不到的方式成真的愿望

**正文**：

I had always wished for a pet, but my parents said our apartment was too small. One rainy afternoon, I found a tiny, shivering kitten hiding under a car. It looked so lonely and scared that I couldn't just leave it there. I carefully picked it up, wrapped it in my jacket, and took it home.

My parents were surprised, but when they saw the poor little thing, their hearts melted. After a visit to the vet, they agreed we could keep him. I named him Lucky. I never expected my wish for a pet would come true by rescuing one myself!

- 我一直都想要一只宠物，但父母总说我们的公寓太小了。一个下雨的午后，我发现一只瑟瑟发抖的幼猫躲在一辆车底下。它看起来那么孤单和害怕，我实在不忍心把它独自留在那里。我小心翼翼地将它抱起，用我的外套包裹住，带回了家。
- 我父母很惊讶，但当他们看到这个可怜的小家伙时，他们的心都融化了。在带它看了兽医之后，他们同意我们可以收养它。我给他取名叫“幸运”。我从未想过，我拥有宠物的愿望会以亲手拯救一个小生命的方式实现！
