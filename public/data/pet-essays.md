## A postcard inviting your cousin to stay with you for a weekend
- 一张邀请你表兄/妹与你共度周末的明信片

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

How are you doing? I hope you're having a great summer. I'm writing to ask if you'd like to come and stay with me for a weekend next month, perhaps from the 15th to the 17th.

There's a new science museum that has just opened downtown, and I thought we could check it out. Also, my parents said we could have a barbecue in the garden on Saturday evening if the weather is nice. It would be a fantastic opportunity to catch up and have some fun.

Let me know if you are free.

Best,
Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- - 你最近怎么样？希望你暑假过得很愉快。我写信是想问你下个月是否愿意来我这里过一个周末，比如说从15号到17号。
- - 市中心新开了一家科学博物馆，我想我们可以一起去看看。而且，我父母说如果周六晚上天气好的话，我们可以在花园里烧烤。这将是一个叙旧和玩乐的绝佳机会。
- - 如果你有空的话，请告诉我。
- - 祝好，
- - 克里斯

## Write a story that ends with: 'I would never forget that day.'
- 写一个以下列句子结尾的故事：“我永远不会忘记那一天。”

**正文**：

It was the day of the local talent show. My hands were trembling as I stood behind the stage curtain, listening to the applause for the previous performer. I had always been shy, and performing a song in front of hundreds of people felt impossible. When my name was called, I took a deep breath and walked to the microphone. The first few notes were shaky, but then I saw my family smiling in the audience. Their support gave me strength. I closed my eyes and sang from my heart. The final cheer from the crowd was overwhelming. I would never forget that day.

- 那是本地才艺表演的日子。我站在舞台幕后，听着前一位表演者获得的掌声，双手不停地颤抖。我一直都很害羞，在几百人面前演唱一首歌感觉像是不可能完成的任务。
- - 当我的名字被叫到时，我深吸了一口气，走向麦克风。最初的几个音符有些颤抖，但随后我看到了观众席中微笑的家人。他们的支持给了我力量。我闭上眼睛，发自内心地歌唱。
- - 最后，观众排山倒海般的欢呼声让我不知所措。我永远不会忘记那一天。
