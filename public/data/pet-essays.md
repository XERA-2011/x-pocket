Subject: Directions to my new place!

Hi Alex,

I'm so excited for you to come to my housewarming party this Saturday!

It's quite easy to get here. If you take the train, get off at Central Station. From there, take the number 5 bus towards the City Library and get off at the third stop, which is Oak Street. Walk straight ahead for about 200 meters, and you'll see a small bakery on the corner. My house is right opposite the bakery, number 34. It has a red door, so you can't miss it!

Let me know if you have any trouble finding it.

Best,
Chris

- 主题：来我新家的路线！
- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 很高兴你这周六能来我的乔迁派对！
- 到这里很方便。如果你坐火车，就在中央车站下车。从那里，乘坐5路公交车，往城市图书馆方向，在第三站橡树街下车。然后直走大约200米，你会在拐角处看到一家小面包店。我的房子就在面包店正对面，是34号。门是红色的，所以你不会错过的！
- 如果找不到路，随时告诉我。
- 祝好，
- 克里斯

**正文**：

My new neighbor, Mr. Harrison, was a grumpy old man who never smiled. He always wore dark clothes and would shout if our ball went into his yard. I thought he was the meanest person in the world. One afternoon, I heard a soft meowing sound from his garden. I peeked through the fence and saw Mr. Harrison gently feeding a tiny, injured kitten. He had made a small bed for it in a box and was speaking to it in a soft, kind voice. That experience taught me never to judge people too quickly.

- 我的新邻居哈里森先生是个从不微笑的暴躁老人。他总是穿着深色的衣服，如果我们的球滚进他的院子，他就会大喊大叫。我曾以为他是世界上最刻薄的人。一天下午，我听到从他花园里传来微弱的猫叫声。我从篱笆缝里偷看，竟看到哈里森先生正在温柔地喂养一只受伤的小猫。他用一个箱子为小猫铺了张小床，并用轻柔、和善的语气跟它说话。那次经历教会了我永远不要过早地对人下定论。
