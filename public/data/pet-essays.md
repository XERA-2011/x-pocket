Subject: We Need More Recycling Bins

Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my views on recycling in our town. I strongly believe that recycling is essential for protecting our environment, and while many people do it at home, it is not always easy to recycle when we are out.

I have noticed there are very few recycling bins in public areas, especially in the town centre and our local parks. This often results in recyclable items like plastic bottles and paper being thrown into general waste bins.

To solve this problem, I think the council should install more recycling bins around the town. This would encourage more people to recycle correctly and help keep our community clean. It would be a simple but effective step for a greener town.

Yours faithfully,

A Local Resident

- 主题：我们需要更多的回收箱
- 
- 尊敬的编辑：
- 
- 我写信是为了分享我对我们城镇回收情况的看法。我坚信回收对于保护我们的环境至关重要，尽管许多人在家中进行回收，但当我们外出时，回收并不总是那么容易。
- 
- 我注意到在公共区域，特别是市中心和我们当地的公园里，回收箱非常少。这常常导致像塑料瓶和纸张这样的可回收物品被扔进普通垃圾箱。
- 
- 为了解决这个问题，我认为市政会应该在城镇各处安装更多的回收箱。这将鼓励更多的人正确回收，并帮助保持我们的社区清洁。对于一个更环保的城镇来说，这将是简单而有效的一步。

- 您真诚的，

The Spring Festival

The most important celebration in my country is the Spring Festival, or Chinese New Year. It is a time for families to get together and welcome the start of a new year according to the lunar calendar.

Preparations begin weeks in advance, with people cleaning their homes to sweep away bad luck. On New Year's Eve, families have a huge dinner together. A popular tradition is for adults to give children money in red envelopes, which wishes them good fortune. People decorate their windows with red paper cuttings and hang lanterns. It’s a very happy and exciting time for everyone.

- 春节
- 
- 在我的国家，最重要的节日是春节，也就是中国新年。这是一个家人团聚、迎接农历新年的时刻。
- 
- 准备工作提前几周就开始了，人们会打扫房屋以扫除坏运气。在除夕夜，家人会一起享用丰盛的晚宴。一个流行的传统是成年人会给孩子们装在红包里的钱，以祝愿他们好运。人们用红色的剪纸装饰窗户，并挂上灯笼。这对每个人来说都是一个非常快乐和激动的时刻。
