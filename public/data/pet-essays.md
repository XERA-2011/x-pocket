## An email to a local newspaper giving your opinion on recycling
- 给当地报社的关于回收利用的观点邮件

**正文**：

Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the recycling facilities in our town. I strongly believe that recycling is essential for protecting our environment. It helps to reduce the amount of waste that goes to landfill sites and also saves valuable natural resources.

While I see many people are trying their best, I think the local council could do more to encourage recycling. For example, placing more recycling bins in public areas like parks and shopping streets would be a great help. Also, clearer information about what can and cannot be recycled would be very useful for all residents.

Thank you for considering my views.

Yours faithfully,
Alex Chen

- 尊敬的编辑，
- 我写信是为了分享我对我们城镇回收设施的看法。我坚信回收利用对于保护我们的环境至关重要。它有助于减少送往垃圾填埋场的废物量，并能节约宝贵的自然资源。
- 尽管我看到许多人都在尽力而为，但我认为地方议会可以采取更多措施来鼓励回收。例如，在公园和商业街等公共区域设置更多的回收箱将会有很大帮助。此外，为所有居民提供关于哪些物品可以回收、哪些不能回收的更清晰信息也会非常有用。
- 感谢您考虑我的观点。
- 忠实的读者，

## An article giving advice on how to make new friends
- 一篇关于如何交新朋友的建议文章

**正文**：

Making new friends can sometimes feel difficult, but there are many ways to meet new people. One of the best methods is to join a club or group that focuses on something you enjoy. Whether it's a sports team, a language class, or a book club, you will meet people with similar interests.

When you are with new people, try to be open and friendly. A simple smile can make you seem more approachable. Don't be afraid to start a conversation; you can ask them about their hobbies or interests. Remember to be a good listener too. People appreciate it when you show genuine interest in them.

- 交新朋友有时会让人觉得困难，但有很多方法可以认识新的人。最好的方法之一就是加入一个你感兴趣的俱乐部或团体。无论是运动队、语言班还是读书会，你都会遇到有相似兴趣的人。
- 和新朋友在一起时，试着开放和友好一些。一个简单的微笑就能让你看起来更容易接近。不要害怕主动开启对话，你可以问问他们关于爱好或兴趣的问题。记住也要做一个好的倾听者。当你对他人表现出真正的兴趣时，人们会很感激。
