## An email to a penfriend describing your typical school day
- 给笔友写一封邮件，描述你平常在学校的一天

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

Thanks for your last email! You asked about my typical school day. Well, it's quite busy. I usually get up at 7 a.m. and have a quick breakfast. School starts at 8:30 a.m. We have four classes in the morning, like Maths and English, with a short break in between.

Lunch is at 12:30 p.m., and I eat with my friends in the canteen. In the afternoon, we have more creative subjects like Art or Music. School finishes at 4 p.m., but I often stay for the basketball club. When I get home, I do my homework and then relax.

Hope to hear from you soon!

Best,
Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 感谢你的上一封邮件！你问我平常在学校是怎样度过的。嗯，日子相当忙碌。我通常早上7点起床，然后迅速吃个早餐。学校8点半开始上课。我们上午有四节课，比如数学和英语，课间有短暂的休息。
- 午餐时间是中午12点半，我和朋友们在食堂吃饭。下午，我们会学习一些更具创造性的科目，比如美术或音乐。学校下午4点放学，但我经常会留下来参加篮球俱乐部。回到家后，我会先做作业，然后再放松一下。
- 希望很快能收到你的回信！
- 此致，
- 克里斯

## A story about helping a stranger
- 一个关于帮助陌生人的故事

**正文**：

Last Saturday, I was walking home from the park when I saw a wallet lying on the pavement. I picked it up and looked inside to find some identification. It belonged to an elderly woman, and her address was on her driver's license. I decided to take it to her house, which was only a few streets away.

When I arrived, I rang the bell, and a worried-looking woman answered. I handed her the wallet, and her face lit up with relief. She was so grateful and offered me a reward, but I politely refused. Helping her was reward enough.

- 上周六，我从公园走路回家时，看到人行道上躺着一个钱包。我捡起它，并查看里面是否有身份证明。钱包属于一位年长的女士，她的驾照上有地址。我决定把钱包送到她家，那里只隔几条街。
- 当我到达时，我按了门铃，一位看起来很焦急的女士开了门。我把钱包递给她，她的脸上立刻露出了释然的表情。她非常感激，并提出要给我一些报酬，但我礼貌地拒绝了。能帮助她本身就足够了。
