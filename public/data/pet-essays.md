## A postcard inviting your cousin to stay with you for a weekend
- 一张邀请你的表兄/妹与你共度周末的明信片

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

How are you doing? I hope you're having a great week.

I'm writing to invite you to come and stay with me for the weekend of September 12th. My parents and I are planning to have a barbecue in our garden on Saturday afternoon, and it would be fantastic if you could join us. We could also go to the new cinema to watch that action movie we were talking about. On Sunday, we can just relax at home or maybe go cycling if the weather is nice.

It would be a great opportunity to catch up. Let me know if you can make it!

Best,
Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 你好吗？希望你这周过得愉快。
- 我写信是想邀请你在9月12那个周末来我这里住。我父母和我计划周六下午在花园里烧烤，如果你能来就太棒了。我们还可以去新开的电影院看我们之前聊过的那部动作片。周日，我们可以在家放松，或者如果天气好的话，可以去骑自行车。
- 这将是叙旧的好机会。告诉我你是否能来！
- 祝好，
- 克里斯

## A story about a memorable journey you took with your family
- 一个关于你和家人的一次难忘旅程的故事

**正文**：

I'll always remember the road trip my family and I took to the coast last year. We decided to drive instead of taking the train because we wanted to enjoy the scenery. We sang along to old songs in the car and stopped at a small village for lunch, which was lovely. When we finally arrived, the view of the ocean from our hotel room was breathtaking. The best part was building a huge sandcastle with my dad, which we decorated with shells. That evening, we watched the sunset together. It was a simple trip, but being together made it truly special.

- 我将永远记得去年我和家人去海边的那次公路旅行。我们决定开车而不是乘火车，因为我们想欣赏沿途的风景。我们在车里跟着老歌一起唱歌，还在一个小村庄停下来吃午饭，感觉非常棒。当我们终于到达时，从酒店房间看出去的海景美得令人窒息。最棒的部分是和爸爸一起堆了一个巨大的沙堡，我们还用贝壳做了装饰。那天晚上，我们一起观看了日落。那是一次简单的旅行，但和家人在一起的时光让它变得无比特别。
