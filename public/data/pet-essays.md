# 记叙文/短文

## Write a story that begins: When I opened the old box, I found something incredible inside.
- 写一个以“当我打开那个旧盒子时，我发现里面有不可思议的东西。”开头的故事。

**正文**：

When I opened the old box, I found something incredible inside. It wasn't gold or jewels, but a collection of faded photographs and a small, intricately carved wooden bird. The photos showed my grandmother as a young woman, laughing with friends I'd never seen. The bird, however, was truly special. As I held it, a faint, melodious tune began to play, seemingly from within the wood itself. It was a lullaby my grandmother used to sing to me. Tears welled up as I realized this box held not just memories, but a piece of her living spirit.

- 当我打开那个旧盒子时，我发现里面有不可思议的东西。那不是金子或珠宝，而是一叠褪色的照片和一只小巧、雕刻精美的木鸟。照片上是我的祖母年轻时的样子，和一些我从未见过的朋友们开心地笑着。然而，那只鸟才是真正特别的。当我握住它时，一段微弱而悠扬的旋律开始响起，仿佛来自木头本身。那是我祖母曾经唱给我听的摇篮曲。泪水涌上我的眼眶，我意识到这个盒子不仅承载着回忆，还承载着她鲜活的灵魂。
