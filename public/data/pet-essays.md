## An email booking tickets for a concert
- 一封预订音乐会门票的电子邮件

**正文**：

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to book four tickets for the "Starlight Symphony" concert on Saturday, November 15th. My friends and I are very excited to see the orchestra perform.

We would like seats in the central area, preferably in rows E to G, as we want a good view of the stage. Could you please let me know if there are any seats available in that section?

Also, could you tell me the price per ticket and how I can pay for them? I would be grateful if you could confirm the booking via email.

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,
Alex Chen

## An article about a young person who inspires you
- 一篇关于一位激励你的年轻人的文章

**正文**：

The young person I admire most is Leo Carter, a teenage inventor from my city. He noticed that many elderly people struggled with loneliness, so he developed a simple, easy-to-use device that connects them with volunteers who can chat or help with daily tasks.

What inspires me is that Leo used his technology skills to solve a real social problem. He spent months researching and coding, showing great determination. His project, "ConnectCare," is now helping hundreds of seniors feel less isolated. Leo proves that you don't have to be an adult to make a positive change in the world.

- 我最欣赏的年轻人是来自我市的青少年发明家 Leo Carter。他注意到许多老年人都在与孤独作斗争，因此他开发了一款简单易用的设备，将他们与可以聊天或帮助处理日常事务的志愿者联系起来。
- 激励我的是，Leo 运用他的技术技能解决了一个真实的社会问题。他花费了数月时间进行研究和编程，展现了巨大的决心。他的项目“ConnectCare”现在正在帮助数百名老年人减少孤独感。Leo 证明了，你不需要成为一个成年人也能为世界带来积极的改变。
