**正文**：

Hi Alex,

Hope you're doing well.

I'm so excited to tell you that my 16th birthday is coming up, and I'm planning a small party to celebrate. I would be really happy if you could come! The party will be at my house next Saturday, September 13th, starting at 6 p.m.

We're going to have a barbecue in the garden, and my dad will be grilling his famous burgers. There will also be music, games, and of course, a big birthday cake. It's going to be a lot of fun. Please let me know if you can make it by Wednesday.

Hope to see you there!

Best,
Chris

## A story about a wish that came true in an unexpected way
- 一个关于愿望以意想不到的方式实现的故事

**正文**：

For years, my biggest wish was to travel abroad. I dreamed of seeing the Eiffel Tower in Paris, but my family couldn't afford such a big trip. One day, our school announced a national French-language competition. The grand prize was a two-week study tour in Lyon, France.

Driven by my dream, I studied harder than ever before. I spent every spare moment practicing. On the day of the final, I was incredibly nervous but did my best. A week later, the results were announced—I had won! It wasn't Paris, but I was going to France. My wish came true in a way I never expected.

- 多年以来，我最大的愿望就是出国旅行。我梦想着能亲眼看看巴黎的埃菲尔铁塔，但我的家庭无法负担如此昂贵的旅行。有一天，我们学校宣布将举办一场全国性的法语竞赛，特等奖是为期两周的法国里昂学习之旅。
- 在梦想的驱动下，我比以往任何时候都更加努力地学习。我利用所有空闲时间进行练习。决赛那天，我紧张极了，但我尽了自己最大的努力。一周后，结果公布了——我赢了！虽然目的地不是巴黎，但我终究是要去法国了。我的愿望以一种我从未预料到的方式实现了。
