## An email booking tickets for a concert
- 一封预订音乐会门票的邮件

**正文**：

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to book two tickets for the "Starlight Symphony" concert on Saturday, October 25th. My friend and I are very excited to attend this event.

Could we please have seats in the central area, preferably between rows 10 and 15? We would like a clear view of the stage.

Please let me know the total cost and how I can make the payment. Could you also inform me if the tickets will be sent by email or if we need to collect them at the box office?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Chris Lee

- 我们可以预订中间区域的座位吗？最好是在第10排到15排之间。我们希望能有清晰的舞台视野。
- 请告知我总费用以及如何付款。另外，您能告诉我门票是通过电子邮件发送还是需要我们去售票处领取吗？
- 感谢您的帮助。
- 此致，

## Write a story ending: That experience taught me never to judge people too quickly.
- 写一个以下列句子结尾的故事：那次经历教会了我永远不要过快地评价一个人。

**正文**：

I was nervous on my first day at the new school. I saw a boy in the corner of the classroom who looked very unfriendly. He wore dark clothes, never smiled, and didn't talk to anyone. I decided to stay away from him.

Later, during the lunch break, I accidentally dropped my tray, and food went everywhere. While others just stared or laughed, the quiet boy immediately came over. He helped me clean up the mess and even shared his own lunch with me. He was actually very kind and shy. That experience taught me never to judge people too quickly.

- 在新学校的第一天，我感到很紧张。我看到教室角落里有一个看起来非常不友好的男孩。他穿着深色的衣服，从不微笑，也不和任何人说话。我决定离他远一点。
- 后来午休时，我不小心打翻了餐盘，食物洒得到处都是。当其他人只是盯着看或嘲笑时，那个安静的男孩立刻走了过来。他帮我清理了残局，甚至把自己的午餐分给了我。他其实非常善良和害羞。那次经历教会了我永远不要过快地评价一个人。
