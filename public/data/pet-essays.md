Hi Sam,

I'm having a fantastic time in London! Yesterday, I visited the Natural History Museum, and it was amazing. The building itself is beautiful, but the best part was the dinosaur exhibition. I saw a huge T-Rex skeleton that was so cool! They also had a special section about earthquakes where you could experience a simulation. It felt so real. The museum is full of incredible things, and I learned so much. You would absolutely love it here.

See you soon,
Alex

- 嗨，山姆，
- 我在伦敦玩得非常开心！昨天，我参观了自然历史博物馆，简直太棒了。建筑本身就很美，但最精彩的部分是恐龙展览。我看到了一个巨大的霸王龙骨架，太酷了！他们还有一个关于地震的特别展区，你可以在那里体验模拟地震。感觉非常真实。博物馆里充满了不可思议的东西，我学到了很多。你绝对会喜欢这里的。
- 回头见，
- 亚历克斯

## An article about a traditional celebration in your country
- 一篇关于你国家传统节日的文章

**正文**：

The Spring Festival is the most important celebration in my country. It's a time for family reunion. Before it begins, everyone cleans their homes to sweep away bad luck. On New Year's Eve, families gather to have a big dinner. We often eat dumplings, which represent wealth. Children receive red envelopes with money inside for good luck. People set off firecrackers to scare away evil spirits and welcome the new year. The festival is full of joy and hope for the future, and the celebrations can last for fifteen days.

- 春节是我国最重要的节日。
- 这是一个家人团聚的时刻。在春节开始前，家家户户都会打扫房屋，以扫除坏运气。除夕夜，家人们会聚在一起吃一顿丰盛的年夜饭。我们通常会吃饺子，因为它象征着财富。孩子们会收到装有压岁钱的红包，寓意着好运。人们会燃放鞭炮来吓跑邪灵，迎接新的一年。这个节日充满了对未来的喜悦和希望，庆祝活动可以持续十五天。
