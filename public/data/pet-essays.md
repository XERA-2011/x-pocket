## An email booking tickets for a concert

**正文**：

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to inquire about booking tickets for the "Starlight" concert, which is scheduled for Saturday, 22nd November. My friends and I are very excited to see this performance.

I would like to purchase three tickets. If possible, we would prefer seats together in the central area, as we want to have a good view of the stage. Could you please inform me of the price per ticket and whether there are any student discounts available?

Please also let me know the available payment methods. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Chris
