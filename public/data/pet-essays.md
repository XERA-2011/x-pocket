## An email giving directions to your new house
- 一封指引前往你新家的邮件

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

I'm so excited for you to visit my new house this Saturday! Here are the directions.

Take the number 15 bus from the city centre and get off at the Oakwood stop, which is right next to a large park. Walk past the park entrance and take the first right onto Maple Avenue. My house is number 23, the one with a bright blue door and some lovely flowers in the front garden. You can't miss it! If you get lost, just give me a call.

See you soon!

Best,
Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 很高兴你这周六能来我的新家！这是路线指引。
- 从市中心乘坐15路公交车，在奥克伍德站下车，车站旁边就是一个大公园。走过公园入口，在第一个路口右转进入枫树大道。我家是23号，门是亮蓝色的，前院里还有一些漂亮的花。你肯定不会错过的！如果迷路了，就给我打电话。
- 期待很快见到你！
- 祝好，
- 克里斯

## Write a story beginning: The phone rang at midnight and changed everything.
- 写一个以下列句子开头的故事：午夜时分，电话铃响了，一切都改变了。

**正文**：

The phone rang at midnight and changed everything. I was half-asleep, but the urgent sound made my heart race. It was my older sister, her voice trembling. "He's gone," she whispered. I didn't need to ask who. Our grandfather, a man who was a mountain of strength for our family, had passed away.

The next few days were a blur of tears and travel. We returned to our childhood home, a place once filled with his laughter. Suddenly, I wasn't a child anymore. I had to be strong for my family, just as he had always been for us.

- 午夜时分，电话铃响了，一切都改变了。我本已半梦半醒，但那急促的铃声让我的心跳加速。是我姐姐打来的，她的声音在颤抖。“他走了，”她低声说。我无需问是谁。我们的祖父，那个曾是我们家力量支柱的男人，去世了。
- 接下来的几天是在泪水和奔波中度过的，一片模糊。我们回到了童年的家，那个曾经充满他笑声的地方。突然间，我不再是个孩子了。我必须为我的家人坚强起来，就像他一直为我们所做的那样。
