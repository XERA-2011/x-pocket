## A postcard to your family from your first week at a new school
- 从新学校第一周寄给家人的明信片

**正文**：

Hi everyone,

I'm having a great time at my new school in London! The first week has been really exciting. My teachers are very friendly, and the lessons are interesting, especially science. I've already made a new friend called Tom. He's in my class, and we both love playing football.

The school building is huge, much bigger than my old one. The food in the canteen is surprisingly good too! I was a bit nervous at first, but everyone has been so welcoming. I'm really looking forward to joining the school's photography club next week.

See you all soon!

Love,
Alex

- 大家好，
- 我在伦敦的新学校过得很开心！第一周真的非常精彩。我的老师们都很友好，课程也很有趣，特别是科学课。我已经交了一个叫汤姆的新朋友。他和我同班，我们都喜欢踢足球。
- 学校的教学楼很大，比我以前的学校大多了。食堂的饭菜也出乎意料地好吃！一开始我还有点紧张，但每个人都非常热情。我真的很期待下周加入学校的摄影俱乐部。
- 希望很快能见到大家！
- 爱你们的，
- 亚历克斯

## A story about overcoming a fear
- 一个关于克服恐惧的故事

**正文**：

I had always been terrified of deep water. The thought of not being able to touch the bottom made my heart race. Last summer, my family went on a trip to a beautiful lake. Everyone was excited about swimming, but I just watched nervously from the shore.

My older sister, Chloe, noticed I was scared. She gently encouraged me to just put my feet in. Step by step, she helped me go a little deeper, always staying right beside me. She showed me how to float on my back. When I finally did it, I felt weightless and free. That day, I didn't become a perfect swimmer, but I overcame my biggest fear.

- 我一直非常害怕深水。一想到脚触不到底，我的心跳就会加速。去年夏天，我们全家去一个美丽的湖边旅行。每个人都对游泳感到兴奋，但我只是紧张地在岸上看着。
- 我的姐姐克洛伊注意到了我的恐惧。她温柔地鼓励我先把脚放进水里。她一步一步地帮助我走得更深一点，始终陪在我身边。她教我如何仰泳。当我终于做到时，我感到失重般的轻松和自由。那天，我并没有成为一个完美的游泳健将，但我克服了自己最大的恐惧。
