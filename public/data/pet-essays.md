## An email to a local newspaper giving your opinion on recycling
- 一封就回收利用问题向当地报纸发表意见的邮件

**正文**：

Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on recycling in our town. I believe recycling is incredibly important for protecting our environment, but we are not doing enough to encourage it. Many people want to recycle, but the lack of facilities makes it difficult.

For example, there are very few public recycling bins, especially in the town centre and parks. I suggest the local council should install more bins for plastic, paper, and glass in these areas. This would make it much more convenient for residents. A small change like this could make a big difference.

Sincerely,
A concerned resident.

- 尊敬的编辑：
- 我写信是为了分享我对我们城镇回收利用的看法。我认为回收对于保护我们的环境极其重要，但我们做得还不够，未能鼓励此举。许多人想要回收，但设施的缺乏使其变得困难。
- 例如，公共回收箱非常少，尤其是在市中心和公园里。我建议地方议会在这些区域安装更多用于回收塑料、纸张和玻璃的箱子。这将为居民提供极大的便利。像这样一个小小的改变可能会带来巨大的不同。
- 此致，
- 一位关心的居民。

## A story about a wish that came true in an unexpected way
- 一个以意想不到的方式成真的愿望

**正文**：

Last week, I was tired of my busy schedule and wished for a quiet day to myself. "If only I could have one day with no interruptions," I thought. The next morning, my wish came true, but not as I had imagined. A huge snowstorm had hit overnight, and the entire town was snowed in.

There was no school, no internet, and no electricity. At first, it was perfect silence. But soon, my family gathered in the living room. We played board games and told stories by the fireplace. It wasn't the solo quiet day I wished for, but this unexpected time together was even better.

- 上周，我对自己繁忙的日程感到厌倦，希望能有一个属于自己的安静日子。“要是我能有一天不被打扰就好了，”我想。第二天早上，我的愿望成真了，但并非如我所想。一场巨大的暴风雪在一夜之间来袭，整个小镇都被大雪封住了。
- 学校停课，网络中断，电力也停了。起初，是完美的寂静。但很快，我的家人聚集在客厅里。我们在壁炉旁玩棋盘游戏，讲故事。这并非我所期望的独自一人的安静日子，但这段意想不到的相聚时光甚至更好。
