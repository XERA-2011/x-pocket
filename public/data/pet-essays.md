Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith,

I am writing to thank you for your incredible kindness during my stay. I have safely returned home, but I already miss our evening chats and the delicious meals you prepared. You made me feel like a real member of your family.

Thanks to your help, my English has improved so much. I particularly enjoyed the weekend trip to the local museum. It was a wonderful experience.

Thank you again for everything. I hope you will visit me in my country one day.

Best wishes,

Alex

## A story about helping a stranger
- [一个关于帮助陌生人的故事]

**正文**：

Last Saturday, I was walking home when I saw an elderly woman struggling with her heavy shopping bags. She looked very tired, and one of the bags suddenly split, sending apples rolling all over the pavement.

I immediately rushed over to help her. I picked up all the apples and put them into my own backpack. Then, I carried her other bag and walked with her to her apartment, which was fortunately just around the corner. She was so grateful and offered me a cup of tea, which I politely accepted. It felt really good to help someone.

- - 上周六，我走在回家的路上，看到一位年长的女士正吃力地提着她沉重的购物袋。她看起来非常疲惫，其中一个袋子突然破了，苹果滚得人行道上到处都是。
- - 我立刻冲过去帮她。我捡起所有的苹果，把它们放进我自己的背包里。然后，我提着她另一个袋子，陪她走到她的公寓，幸运的是，公寓就在拐角处。她非常感激，还请我喝了一杯茶，我礼貌地接受了。帮助别人的感觉真的很好。
