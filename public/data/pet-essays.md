Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to book tickets for the film 'Planet of Wonders', which is showing at your cinema next week. I would like to reserve four tickets for the 8 PM screening on Saturday, August 16th.

We would prefer seats in the central area of the cinema, if possible, as we want to have the best viewing experience. Could you please let me know if these seats are available and what the total cost will be? Please also inform me about how I can pay for the tickets.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

## A story about a time you learned an important lesson
- 一个关于你学到重要一课的故事

**正文**：

Last summer, I decided to join a swimming competition even though I wasn't a strong swimmer. I thought winning would be easy. I didn't practice much, spending my time playing video games instead. On the day of the competition, I felt nervous when I saw the other swimmers, who all looked very professional and confident.

As soon as the race started, I was quickly left behind. I struggled to finish, feeling exhausted and embarrassed. I came in last place. That day, I learned a very important lesson: success only comes with hard work and preparation. There are no shortcuts.

- 去年夏天，我决定参加一场游泳比赛，尽管我游得并不好。我以为赢会很容易。我没有怎么练习，而是把时间花在了玩电子游戏上。比赛那天，当我看到其他选手时，我感到很紧张，他们看起来都非常专业和自信。
- 比赛一开始，我很快就落后了。我挣扎着游完全程，感到筋疲力尽和尴尬。我得了最后一名。那天，我学到了非常重要的一课：成功只来自于努力和准备。没有任何捷径可走。
