## A postcard from your exchange program abroad
- 来自你的海外交换项目的明信片

**正文**：

Hi everyone,

Greetings from sunny Barcelona! I'm having an absolutely amazing time on my exchange program. My host family is incredibly kind and the food here is delicious, especially the paella. I've made lots of new friends from different countries at the language school, and my Spanish is getting better every day.

Last weekend, we visited the Sagrada Familia and it was breathtaking. There's so much to see and do here. I miss you all, but I'm learning so much. Can't wait to share all my stories with you when I return!

Best wishes,
Alex

- 大家好，
- 来自阳光明媚的巴塞罗那的问候！我在这里的交换项目过得非常愉快。我的寄宿家庭非常友善，这里的食物也很美味，尤其是海鲜饭。我在语言学校结交了许多来自不同国家的新朋友，我的西班牙语每天都在进步。
- 上个周末，我们参观了圣家堂，它简直令人叹为观止。这里有太多可看可做的事情了。我很想念大家，但我也学到了很多东西。等我回去后，我迫不及待地想和你们分享我所有的故事！
- 最好的祝愿，
- 亚历克斯

## Write a story about a misunderstanding that had a happy ending
- 写一个关于误会最终带来圆满结局的故事

**正文**：

Last Tuesday, I arranged to meet my friend Sarah at the library at 3 p.m. to study. I waited for over an hour, but she never appeared. I felt really upset and a bit angry, thinking she had forgotten our plan. I went home feeling disappointed and ignored her calls that evening.

The next day, she found me at school and looked worried. "What happened?" she asked. I told her I had waited for ages. She looked confused and then showed me my message. I had accidentally typed "meet at the liberty," and she had been waiting at the Liberty Cafe across town! We both started laughing. The misunderstanding was silly, but it taught us to communicate more clearly.

- 上周二，我约了朋友莎拉下午3点在图书馆见面学习。我等了一个多小时，但她一直没有出现。我感到非常难过和有点生气，以为她忘记了我们的计划。我失望地回了家，并在那天晚上无视了她的电话。
- 第二天，她在学校找到了我，看起来很担心。“发生什么事了？”她问。我告诉她我等了很久。她看起来很困惑，然后给我看了我的短信。我竟然不小心打成了“在自由咖啡馆见面”，而她一直在城另一头的自由咖啡馆等我！我们俩都笑了起来。这个误会很傻，但它教会了我们要更清晰地沟通。
