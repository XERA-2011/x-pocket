**主题**：A letter to the school principal suggesting an improvement

**正文**：
Dear Principal Thompson,

My name is Alex, and I am a student in Class 10B. I am writing to suggest an improvement for our school. I think it would be a great idea to create a new student lounge.

Currently, we don't have a comfortable place to relax during our breaks. A lounge with some sofas, tables, and maybe a few board games would be wonderful. It would give us a space to socialize, do homework, and unwind between classes. This could help improve student well-being and build a stronger school community.

Thank you for considering my suggestion.

Yours sincerely,
Alex Johnson

## 作文二：记叙文/短文

**主题**：Write a story that begins with the sentence: 'The door opened slowly and I couldn't believe who I saw.'

**正文**：
The door opened slowly and I couldn't believe who I saw. It was my grandfather. He had been living in Australia for the past ten years, and we all missed him dearly. I thought he wasn't supposed to visit until next summer. I stood there, completely speechless, as he stepped inside with a huge smile on his face. "Aren't you going to give your old grandpa a hug?" he asked, opening his arms wide. I ran to him, tears of joy streaming down my face. It was the best surprise I had ever received.
