## An email apologizing to a friend for missing their party
- 一封向朋友致歉未能参加其聚会的邮件

**正文**：

Hi Sarah,

I’m writing to say I’m so sorry that I missed your birthday party last Friday night. I was really excited to celebrate with you.

Unfortunately, I had a family emergency. My grandmother suddenly felt unwell, and we had to take her to the hospital. We were all very worried, and I completely forgot to message you. I hope you can understand.

I heard from Tom that the party was amazing. I would love to see the photos! Let’s meet up for coffee next week so you can tell me all about it.

Best,
Alex

- 嗨，莎拉，
- 我写这封邮件是想告诉你，我非常抱歉错过了上周五晚你的生日聚会。我之前真的很期待能和你一起庆祝。
- 不幸的是，我家里出了点急事。我的奶奶突然感到不舒服，我们必须送她去医院。我们都非常担心，我完全忘记了给你发消息。希望你能理解。
- 我从汤姆那里听说聚会非常棒。我很想看看照片！我们下周约个时间喝杯咖啡吧，这样你就可以给我讲讲聚会上的所有事情了。
- 此致，
- 亚历克斯

**正文**：

Our new neighbor, Mr. Harrison, was an old man who always looked grumpy. He never smiled or said hello, and his garden was messy. My friends and I thought he was mean. One afternoon, my ball accidentally flew into his yard. I was scared, but I went to his door. When he opened it, I saw he was holding a tiny, injured bird. He explained he spent all his time caring for wounded animals. His "messy" garden was actually a sanctuary for wildlife. He smiled gently and gave my ball back. That experience taught me never to judge people too quickly.

- 我们的新邻居哈里森先生是一位看起来总是很 grumpy（脾气暴躁）的老人。他从不微笑，也不打招呼，而且他的花园总是乱糟糟的。我和我的朋友们都认为他很刻薄。
- 一天下午，我的球不小心飞进了他的院子。我很害怕，但我还是走到了他家门口。当他打开门时，我看到他正捧着一只受伤的小鸟。
- 他解释说，他把所有时间都花在了照顾受伤的动物上。他那“乱糟糟”的花园实际上是一个野生动物的庇护所。他温和地笑了笑，把球还给了我。那次经历教会了我永远不要过早地对人下定论。
