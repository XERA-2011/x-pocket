## An email to a penfriend describing your typical school day
- 给笔友写一封邮件，描述你平常在学校的一天

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

Thanks for your last email! You asked about my school day. Well, it's quite busy. My classes start at 8 a.m., so I usually get to school around 7:45. In the morning, we have subjects like Maths and Science, which are interesting but sometimes difficult.

We have a lunch break at noon. I eat with my friends in the canteen, and we chat about our day. In the afternoon, we have more creative classes, such as Art and Music, which I really enjoy. School finishes at 4 p.m., but I often stay for football practice. It's a long day, but I like it!

Best wishes,
Sam

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 感谢你上次的邮件！你问我平常在学校是怎样度过的。嗯，日子相当忙碌。我的课早上8点开始，所以我通常7点45分左右到校。上午，我们有数学和科学这样的科目，这些课很有趣，但有时也挺难的。
- 我们中午有午休时间。我和朋友们在食堂吃饭，聊聊我们一天的情况。下午，我们有更具创造性的课程，比如我非常喜欢的美术和音乐。学校下午4点放学，但我经常会留下来参加足球训练。这是漫长的一天，但我很喜欢！
- 最好的祝愿，
- 山姆

## An article reviewing a movie that all teenagers should watch
- 一篇影评，推荐一部所有青少年都该看的电影

**正文**：

**A Movie for Everyone: "Inside Out"**

If you are looking for a fantastic movie, you must watch "Inside Out". This animated film is about a young girl named Riley and her emotions: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust. When Riley's family moves to a new city, her emotions get very confused and have to learn to work together.

I think all teenagers should see this film. It's not just funny and colourful, but it also teaches an important lesson about feelings. It shows that it's okay to be sad sometimes and that all our emotions are important. "Inside Out" helps you understand yourself better. Don't miss it!

- **一部适合所有人的电影：《头脑特工队》**
- 如果你正在寻找一部精彩的电影，你一定要看《头脑特工队》。这部动画电影讲述了一个名叫莱莉的小女孩和她的五种情绪：乐乐、忧忧、怒怒、怕怕和厌厌。当莱莉全家搬到一个新城市时，她的情绪们变得非常困惑，必须学会如何共同协作。
- 我认为所有青少年都应该看这部电影。它不仅有趣、色彩鲜艳，还教会了我们关于情感的重要一课。它告诉我们，有时候感到悲伤是完全正常的，而且我们所有的情绪都至关重要。《头脑特工队》能帮助你更好地了解自己。千万不要错过！
