## An email to a friend recommending a new restaurant you tried
- 一封向朋友推荐你尝试过的新餐厅的邮件

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

How are you? I'm writing to tell you about an amazing new restaurant I tried last night called "The Corner Bistro." You would love it!

They serve fantastic Italian food. I had the best pizza I've ever tasted, and the pasta looked delicious too. The atmosphere is really cozy and relaxed, with soft music playing in the background. The staff were also incredibly friendly and helpful.

It's not too expensive either. We should definitely go together next weekend. Let me know if you're free.

Best,
Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 
- 你好吗？我写信是想告诉你，我昨晚去了一家超棒的新餐厅，叫做“街角小馆”。你一定会喜欢的！
- 
- 他们提供非常美味的意大利菜。我吃到了我尝过最棒的比萨，而且他们的意面看起来也很好吃。餐厅的氛围非常舒适和放松，背景里还放着轻柔的音乐。员工们也非常友好和乐于助人。
- 
- 而且价格也不算太贵。我们下周末一定要一起去。如果你有空的话，告诉我一声。
- 
- 祝好，
- 克里斯

## Write a story that begins: When I opened the old box, I found something incredible inside.
- 写一个以下列句子开头的故事：当我打开那个旧盒子时，我在里面发现了一件不可思议的东西。

**正文**：

When I opened the old box, I found something incredible inside. It was a small, silver compass that looked ancient. As I picked it up, the dust fell away to reveal strange symbols engraved around its edge.

Suddenly, the needle started to spin wildly. It didn't point north. Instead, it stopped and pointed directly at an old map I had on my wall. I looked closer and saw a tiny island on the map that I had never noticed before. A feeling of excitement rushed through me. This compass wasn't just old; it was magical.

- 当我打开那个旧盒子时，我在里面发现了一件不可思议的东西。那是一个小巧的银色罗盘，看起来非常古老。当我拿起它时，灰尘簌簌落下，露出了边缘刻着的奇怪符号。
- 
- 突然，罗盘的指针开始疯狂地旋转。它并没有指向北方，而是停了下来，直直地指向我墙上挂着的一张旧地图。我凑近一看，发现地图上有一个我从未注意过的小岛。一股兴奋感涌遍我的全身。这个罗盘不只是个旧物件，它拥有魔力。
