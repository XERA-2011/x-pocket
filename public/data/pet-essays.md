## An email inviting your cousin to visit you during the holidays
- 一封邀请表兄/妹假期来访的邮件

**正文**：

Hi [Cousin's Name],

How are you doing? The summer holiday is just around the corner, and I was thinking it would be great if you could come and stay with us for a week.

We could do so many fun things together! There's a new science museum that just opened downtown which looks amazing. We could also spend a day at the beach, and in the evenings, we can watch all the new movies we've missed. My parents would be thrilled to see you too.

Let me know if you think you can make it. I really hope you can come!

Best,

[Your Name]
