## An email to a friend giving them directions to your house
- 给朋友写一封电子邮件，告诉他们去你家的路线

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

I'm so excited for you to come over this Saturday! Here are the directions to my place.

Take the number 10 bus from the city centre and get off at the Oakwood stop, which is right by a large supermarket. From there, walk straight down the main road for about five minutes until you see a small park on your left. My street, Pine Lane, is the first turning on the right after the park. My house is number 22, and it has a bright blue door. You can't miss it!

Let me know if you have any trouble finding it.

Best,
Sam

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 很高兴你这周六能过来！这是来我家的路线。
- 从市中心乘坐10路公交车，在奥克伍德站下车，车站旁边有一个大型超市。从那里沿着主路直走大约五分钟，直到你看到左边有一个小公园。我的街道，松树巷，是公园后的第一个右转弯。我家是22号，有一个亮蓝色的门。你不会错过的！
- 如果你找不到路，请告诉我。
- 祝好，
- 山姆

## Write a story about a funny misunderstanding
- 写一个关于有趣误会的故事

**正文**：

Last week, I went to a café to meet myfriend, Bill. I saw a man with the same red jacket and curly hair sitting by the window, so I walked over and tapped his shoulder. "Bill, you won't believe what happened to me this morning!" I exclaimed. The man turned around with a very confused look. He wasn't Bill at all. Just then, the real Bill walked in and started laughing. The man I had approached then smiled and said, "I'm also waiting for someone named Bill!" We all shared a good laugh about the coincidence.

- 上周，我去一家咖啡馆见我的朋友比尔。
- 我看到一个穿着同样红色夹克、留着卷发的男人坐在窗边，于是我走过去拍了拍他的肩膀。
- “比尔，你绝对想不到我今天早上发生了什么！”我大声说道。
- 那个男人转过身来，一脸困惑。他根本不是比尔。
- 就在那时，真正的比尔走了进来，开始大笑。
- 我搭话的那个男人也笑了起来，说：“我也在等一个叫比尔的人！”
- 我们都为这个巧合笑了起来。
