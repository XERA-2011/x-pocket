## A letter to the school principal suggesting an improvement
- 一封给校长的建议信

**正文**:

Dear Principal Dawson,

I am writing to suggest an improvement for our school. I think it would be a great idea to create a small garden on the school roof.

Many students, including myself, feel that having a green space would help us relax between classes. We could grow flowers and maybe some vegetables. This project would not only make our school more beautiful but also teach us about nature and responsibility. Students could volunteer to take care of the garden.

Thank you for considering my suggestion. I hope this idea can become a reality.

Yours sincerely,

Alex Chen

- 尊敬的道森校长：
- 我写信是为了对我们学校提出一项改进建议。我认为在学校屋顶上创建一个小花园会是一个很棒的主意。
- 包括我自己在内的许多学生都觉得，拥有一个绿色空间能帮助我们在课间放松。我们可以种植花卉，或许还有一些蔬菜。这个项目不仅能让我们的学校更美丽，还能教会我们关于自然和责任的知识。学生们可以自愿来照料花园。
- 感谢您考虑我的建议。我希望这个想法能成为现实。
- 此致，
- Alex Chen

## An article for young people about how to use social media safely
- 一篇给年轻人关于如何安全使用社交媒体的文章

**正文**:

Social media is a fantastic way to connect with friends, but it's important to stay safe. Here are some tips for you.

First, think carefully about your privacy settings. Make sure only your friends can see what you post. Secondly, never share personal information like your home address or phone number online. It's also a good idea to think before you post photos or comments, because they can be online forever. Finally, if you see anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, tell a parent or a teacher immediately.

Enjoy social media, but remember to be smart and safe!

- 社交媒体是与朋友联系的绝佳方式，但保持安全非常重要。这里有一些给你的提示。
- 首先，仔细考虑你的隐私设置。确保只有你的朋友能看到你发布的内容。其次，绝不要在网上分享你的家庭住址或电话号码等个人信息。在发布照片或评论前三思也是个好主意，因为它们可能会永远留在网上。最后，如果你看到任何让你感到不舒服的内容，立即告诉父母或老师。
- 尽情享受社交媒体吧，但要记得保持聪明和安全！
