## An email to a friend about a party you are organizing
- 一封关于你正在组织的派对的邮件

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

Hope you're doing well!

I'm writing to invite you to a party I'm organizing to celebrate the end of our exams. It's going to be at my place next Saturday, June 15th. I'm planning to start around 7 p.m.

I'll prepare some pizzas and snacks, but it would be great if you could bring some drinks to share. We'll have some good music, and I've also got some fun board games we can play. I really hope you can make it, as it won't be the same without you!

Let me know if you can come.

Best,
Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 希望你一切都好！
- 我写信是想邀请你参加我为庆祝考试结束而组织的派对。派对将于下周六，也就是6月15日，在我的家里举行。我计划在晚上7点左右开始。
- 我会准备一些披萨和零食，但如果你能带些饮料来分享就再好不过了。我们会有很棒的音乐，我还准备了一些有趣的桌游可以玩。我真的希望你能来，没有你派对会大不相同！
- 如果你能来，请告诉我。
- 祝好，
- 克里斯

## An article for young people about how to use social media safely
- 一篇为年轻人写的关于如何安全使用社交媒体的文章

**正文**：

Social media is a great way to connect with friends, but it's important to stay safe. Firstly, always think about your privacy. Avoid sharing personal information like your full name, address, or phone number online. Use strong, unique passwords for your accounts to protect them.

Secondly, think before you post. Once something is online, it can be there forever. Only share photos and comments that you are happy for anyone to see. Finally, be careful about who you talk to. Don't accept friend requests from strangers. If anyone makes you feel uncomfortable, tell a trusted adult immediately.

- 社交媒体是与朋友联系的好方法，但保持安全非常重要。首先，要时刻考虑你的隐私。避免在网上分享你的全名、地址或电话号码等个人信息。为你的账户使用强大且独特的密码来保护它们。
- 其次，发布前请三思。一旦内容发布到网上，它可能就永远存在了。只分享那些你乐意让任何人看到的照片和评论。最后，要小心你交谈的对象。不要接受陌生人的好友请求。如果有人让你感到不舒服，立即告诉一位你信任的成年人。
