Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to ask for information about joining your sports club. I am new to the area and very interested in playing tennis and swimming.

Could you please tell me about the monthly membership fees? I would also like to know what facilities you have, especially the number of tennis courts and if there is an indoor swimming pool. Furthermore, could you let me know your opening hours during the week and at weekends? Finally, I was wondering if you have any special offers for new members.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

## A story about a dream that came true
- 一个梦想成真的故事

**正文**：

Ever since I was a little boy, my biggest dream was to see Paris. I had posters of the Eiffel Tower on my wall and read many books about the city. But my family never had enough money to travel abroad.

Last year, I won a national art competition. The grand prize was a trip for two to any European capital. I couldn't believe it! Of course, I chose Paris. The moment I stood beneath the sparkling Eiffel Tower at night was magical. It felt unreal, even better than my dreams. That trip taught me that dreams can come true if you work hard and never give up.

- 从我还是个小男孩起，我最大的梦想就是去看看巴黎。我的墙上贴着埃菲尔铁塔的海报，还读了很多关于这座城市的书。但我的家人一直没有足够的钱出国旅行。
- 去年，我赢得了一个全国性的艺术比赛。最高奖项是双人欧洲任一首都游。我简直不敢相信！我当然选择了巴黎。当夜晚我站在闪闪发光的埃菲尔铁塔下时，那一刻真是太奇妙了。感觉很不真实，甚至比我的梦境还要美好。那次旅行教会了我，只要你努力并不放弃，梦想就能够实现。
