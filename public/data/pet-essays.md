## An email to your headteacher suggesting a new school club
- 给校长写一封关于建立新社团建议的邮件

**正文**：

Dear Mr. Smith,

I am writing to suggest the creation of a new school club: a Creative Writing Club. Many students, including myself, are passionate about writing stories and poems but have no formal platform to share our work or improve our skills.

This club would be a fantastic opportunity for us to develop our creativity and communication abilities. We could hold weekly meetings to discuss our writing, give each other feedback, and even invite local authors for talks. I believe this club would greatly enrich our school’s cultural life.

Thank you for considering my suggestion.

Yours sincerely,
Chris Green

- 尊敬的史密斯先生，
- 我写信是为了建议学校成立一个新的社团：创意写作社。包括我自己在内的许多同学都对写故事和诗歌充满热情，但我们没有一个正式的平台来分享我们的作品或提升我们的写作技巧。
- 这个社团将为我们提供一个绝佳的机会来发展我们的创造力和沟通能力。我们可以每周举行会议，讨论我们的作品，互相给予反馈，甚至可以邀请本地作家来做讲座。我相信这个社团将极大地丰富我们学校的文化生活。
- 感谢您考虑我的建议。
- 诚挚的，
- 克里斯·格林

## Write a story ending: That experience taught me never to judge people too quickly.
- 写一个以下列句子结尾的故事：那次经历教会了我永远不要过早地对人下定论。

**正文**：

Our new classmate, Leo, was always quiet and never joined our games. We all thought he was unfriendly. One day, during a fierce storm, the lights in our classroom suddenly went out. Everyone panicked in the darkness. While we were all shouting, Leo calmly took out a small torch from his bag and found the emergency light switch. He then helped our teacher guide everyone out of the room safely. We were all surprised by his calmness and resourcefulness. That experience taught me never to judge people too quickly.

- 我们的新同学里奥总是很安静，从不参加我们的游戏。我们都以为他很不友好。一天，在一场猛烈的暴风雨中，我们教室的灯突然熄灭了。在黑暗中，所有人都惊慌失措。当我们都在尖叫时，里奥冷静地从书包里拿出一个小手电筒，找到了应急灯的开关。随后，他帮助老师引导大家安全地撤离了房间。我们都对他的冷静和足智多谋感到惊讶。那次经历教会了我永远不要过早地对人下定论。
