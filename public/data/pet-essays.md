Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to inquire about joining your gym. I have recently moved to this area and I am looking for a place to exercise.

Could you please provide me with information on your membership options? I am particularly interested in the monthly fees and whether you offer any discounts for new members.

Furthermore, I would like to know more about your facilities. Specifically, do you have a swimming pool and are there any group classes, such as yoga or spinning, included in the membership?

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

# 记叙文/短文

## Write a story that begins: When I opened the old box, I found something incredible inside.
- 写一个以下列句子开头的故事：当我打开那个旧盒子时，我在里面发现了一件不可思议的东西。

**正文**：

When I opened the old box, I found something incredible inside. It wasn't treasure or gold, but a small, leather-bound diary. The pages were yellow with age, and the handwriting was elegant. As I began to read, I realised it belonged to my great-grandfather, who was an explorer.

The diary told amazing stories of his adventures in forgotten jungles and lost cities. He wrote about mysterious creatures and ancient secrets. The last entry was dated seventy years ago and described a hidden waterfall. He had left a map tucked inside the back cover. I knew then my own adventure was just beginning.

- 当我打开那个旧盒子时，我在里面发现了一件不可思议的东西。那不是金银财宝，而是一本小小的皮面日记。书页因年代久远而泛黄，字迹十分优雅。当我开始阅读时，我意识到这本日记属于我的曾祖父，他曾是一位探险家。
- 日记讲述了他-在被遗忘的丛林和失落的城市中奇妙的冒险故事。他记录了神秘的生物和古老的秘密。最后一篇日记的日期是七十年前，描述了一个隐秘的瀑布。他在封底里夹了一张地图。那一刻我便知道，我自己的冒险才刚刚开始。
