A letter to the school principal suggesting an improvement
- 给校长的一封建议改进的信

**正文**：

Dear Principal Thompson,

My name is Alex, and I am a student in Class 10B. I am writing to suggest an improvement for our school. I think it would be a great idea to create a new student lounge.

Currently, we don't have a comfortable place to relax during our breaks. A lounge with some sofas, tables, and maybe a few board games would be wonderful. It would give us a space to socialize, do homework, and unwind between classes. This could help improve student well-being and build a stronger school community.

Thank you for considering my suggestion.

Yours sincerely,
Alex Johnson

- 尊敬的汤普森校长，
- 我叫亚历克斯，是10B班的学生。我写信建议我们学校改进一下。我认为创建一个新的学生休息室是个好主意。
- 目前，我们休息时没有一个舒适的地方放松。一个有沙发、桌子，也许还有一些棋盘游戏的休息室会很棒。这将给我们一个社交、做作业和课间放松的空间。这可能有助于提高学生的幸福感，并建立一个更强大的学校社区。
- 谢谢你考虑我的建议。
- 你真诚的，
- 亚历克斯·约翰逊

# 记叙文/短文

Write a story that begins with the sentence: 'The door opened slowly and I couldn't believe who I saw.'
- 写一个故事，以这句话开头：“门慢慢打开，我简直不敢相信我看到了谁。”

**正文**：

The door opened slowly and I couldn't believe who I saw. It was my grandfather. He had been living in Australia for the past ten years, and we all missed him dearly. I thought he wasn't supposed to visit until next summer. I stood there, completely speechless, as he stepped inside with a huge smile on his face. "Aren't you going to give your old grandpa a hug?" he asked, opening his arms wide. I ran to him, tears of joy streaming down my face. It was the best surprise I had ever received.

- 门慢慢地开了，我简直不敢相信我看到了谁。是我爷爷。他在澳大利亚生活了十年，我们都非常想念他。我以为他要到明年夏天才能来。我站在那里，完全说不出话来，他脸上带着灿烂的笑容走了进去。“你不抱抱你的老爷爷吗？”他张开双臂问。我跑向他，喜悦的泪水顺着脸颊流下。这是我收到的最好的惊喜。
