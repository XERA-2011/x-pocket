**正文**:

Hi Tom,

I’m so sorry for not making it to your birthday party last Saturday. I was really looking forward to celebrating with you.

Unfortunately, my grandmother fell ill, and my parents had to take her to the hospital. I went with them to help out. We were there all night, and I didn't have a chance to message you. I hope you understand.

I heard it was a fantastic party. I’d love to catch up soon and hear all about it. Let's meet for coffee next week – my treat!

Best,
David

- 嗨，汤姆，
- 上周六没能参加你的生日派对，我真的非常抱歉。我本来非常期待和你一起庆祝的。
- 不幸的是，我的奶奶生病了，我父母不得不带她去医院。我跟着他们去帮忙。我们在那里待了一整晚，我没有机会给你发消息。希望你能理解。
- 我听说派对非常棒。我很想尽快和你见个面，听你讲讲派对的趣事。我们下周一起喝杯咖啡吧——我请客！
- 此致，
- 大卫

## A story about overcoming a fear
- 一个关于克服恐惧的故事

**正文**:

I used to be terrified of speaking in public. My heart would pound, and my hands would shake just thinking about it. Last month, I had to give a presentation for my English class. I knew I couldn't avoid it.

For a week, I practiced in front of a mirror and with my family. When the day came, I was still nervous, but I took a deep breath and walked to the front of the class. I started speaking, and although my voice trembled at first, I soon found my confidence. I focused on my topic and my classmates' friendly faces.

Finishing the presentation felt like a huge victory. It wasn't perfect, but I did it. Now, I feel much more comfortable speaking in front of others.

- 我曾经非常害怕在公共场合讲话。只要一想到这件事，我的心就会狂跳，双手也会发抖。上个月，我必须为我的英语课做一个演示。我知道我无法逃避。
- 我花了一周的时间，在镜子前和家人面前练习。到了那一天，我仍然很紧张，但我深吸了一口气，走到了教室前面。我开始讲话，虽然起初我的声音有些颤抖，但我很快就找到了自信。我专注于我的主题和同学们友善的面孔。
- 完成演示感觉就像一次巨大的胜利。虽然不完美，但我做到了。现在，我在别人面前讲话时感觉自在多了。
