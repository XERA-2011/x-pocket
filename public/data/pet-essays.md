Hi [Cousin's Name],

How are you? I hope everything's great! The holidays are coming up soon, and I was wondering if you'd like to come and stay with me for a few days. We could have so much fun!

I'm thinking of going to the new amusement park, watching some movies, and maybe even baking cookies. My parents would be thrilled to see you too.

Let me know if you're free and if you'd like to come. We can pick a date that works for both of us.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
[Your Name]

## An article about a young person who inspires you
- 一篇关于一个激励你的年轻人的文章

**正文**：

My younger sister, Lily, truly inspires me. She's only fifteen, but her dedication to environmental causes is remarkable. Last year, she started a recycling program at her school, which significantly reduced waste. She also volunteers every weekend at a local animal shelter, showing incredible compassion.

Lily always researches sustainable living practices and shares them with our family. Her passion isn't just talk; she actively makes a difference. Seeing her commitment makes me want to be more proactive in my own community. She proves that age is no barrier to making a positive impact on the world.

- 我的妹妹莉莉，真的激励着我。她才十五岁，但她对环保事业的奉献精神令人瞩目。去年，她在学校发起了一项回收计划，大大减少了浪费。她每个周末还在当地的动物收容所做志愿者，展现出令人难以置信的同情心。
- 莉莉总是研究可持续生活方式，并与我们家人分享。她的热情不仅仅是说说而已；她积极地做出改变。看到她的投入，让我也想在自己的社区中更加积极主动。她证明了年龄并不是对世界产生积极影响的障碍。
