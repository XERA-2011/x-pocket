## A postcard inviting your cousin to stay with you for a weekend
- 一张邀请你表兄/妹与你共度周末的明信片

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

How are you doing? I hope everything is going well.

I'm writing to invite you to stay with me for the weekend of October 12th. The weather should be lovely then, and there's a fantastic new film I want to see. We could also go hiking on Saturday morning if you're interested. On Sunday, we can just relax at home, play some video games, and maybe bake a cake.

It would be great to catch up properly. Let me know if you can make it.

Best,
Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 你最近怎么样？希望一切顺利。
- 我写信是想邀请你在10月12那个周末来我这里住。那时的天气应该会很不错，而且有一部我想看的很棒的新电影。如果你感兴趣的话，我们周六早上还可以去远足。周日我们就在家放松，玩玩电子游戏，或许再烤个蛋糕。
- 能和你好好聚聚就太好了。告诉我你是否能来。
- 祝好，
- 克里斯

**正文**：

It was a dark, stormy night. I was alone at home, reading a book, when suddenly, I heard a scratching sound at the door. I thought it was just the wind, but it came again, louder this time. Cautiously, I walked to the door and looked through the peephole. I saw nothing but rain.

Slowly, I opened the door. A tiny, wet kitten was sitting on my doorstep, shivering. It looked up at me with big, sad eyes. My heart melted. I carefully picked it up, brought it inside, and wrapped it in a warm towel.

- 那是一个漆黑的暴风雨之夜。我独自在家看书，突然听到门上传来一阵抓挠声。我以为只是风声，但声音又响起了，这次更大了。我小心翼翼地走到门口，通过猫眼往外看。除了雨，我什么也没看到。
- 我慢慢地打开门。一只湿漉漉的、瑟瑟发抖的小猫正坐在我的门阶上。它用一双大而悲伤的眼睛望着我。我的心都融化了。我小心地将它抱起，带进屋里，用一条温暖的毛巾把它包了起来。
