## A postcard to your family from your first week at a new school
- [从新学校第一周寄给家人的明信片]

**正文**：

Hi everyone,

I'm having a fantastic time at my new school! The campus is much bigger than my old one, and it's really beautiful. My teachers are very kind and helpful, and I've already made some new friends in my classes. We often study together in the library after school.

This weekend, I'm planning to join the school's basketball club. The food in the canteen is surprisingly delicious, especially the pizza. I'm learning so much and feeling really happy here.

Miss you all and can't wait to see you soon!

Best wishes,
Alex

- 大家好，
- 我在新学校过得非常愉快！校园比我以前的学校大得多，而且非常漂亮。我的老师们都非常和蔼可亲，乐于助人，我已经在班上交到了一些新朋友。我们放学后经常一起在图书馆学习。
- 这个周末，我打算加入学校的篮球俱乐部。食堂的饭菜出乎意料地好吃，尤其是披萨。我在这里学到了很多东西，感觉非常开心。
- 想念你们大家，希望能很快见到你们！
- 最好的祝愿，
- 亚历克斯

## An article about why young people should volunteer in their community
- [一篇关于年轻人为什么应该在社区做志愿者的文章]

**正文**：

Volunteering offers young people a brilliant opportunity to contribute to their community. By giving just a few hours of their time, they can make a significant difference, whether it's by helping at a local animal shelter, cleaning up a park, or supporting elderly neighbours.

This experience is not only beneficial for the community but also for the volunteers themselves. It's a fantastic way to develop valuable skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. Moreover, it can boost self-confidence and help young people meet others who are passionate about making a positive impact. It’s a truly rewarding experience.

- 志愿服务为年轻人提供了一个为社区做贡献的绝佳机会。只需付出几个小时的时间，他们就能带来巨大的改变，无论是在当地的动物收容所帮忙，清理公园，还是帮助年长的邻居。
- 这种经历不仅对社区有益，对志愿者自身也大有裨益。这是培养团队合作、沟通和解决问题等宝贵技能的绝佳方式。此外，它还能增强自信心，帮助年轻人结识其他热衷于产生积极影响的人。这确实是一种非常有益的经历。
