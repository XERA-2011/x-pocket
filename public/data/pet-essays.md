## An email to a friend asking for advice about choosing a university course
- 一封向朋友寻求选择大学课程建议的邮件

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

Hope you're doing well. I'm writing to you because I need some advice. I'm trying to decide on a university course, but I'm feeling a bit lost. I've always been passionate about computers and technology, but recently I've also developed a strong interest in environmental science.

I'm not sure how to choose between them. You're always so good at making decisions, and I was wondering if you had any thoughts. What factors do you think are most important to consider? Any advice you could offer would be a great help.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 希望你一切都好。我写信给你是因为我需要一些建议。我正在努力决定大学要读什么课程，但感觉有些迷茫。我一直对计算机和技术充满热情，但最近我也对环境科学产生了浓厚的兴趣。
- 我不知道该如何在两者之间做出选择。你总是那么擅长做决定，所以我想知道你是否有什么想法。你认为在做决定时，最重要的考虑因素是什么？你能提供的任何建议都将对我大有帮助。
- 期待你的回复。
- 最好的祝愿，
- 克里斯

## An article about a traditional celebration in your country
- 一篇关于你国家传统节日的文章

**正文**：

The Mid-Autumn Festival is one of the most important traditional celebrations in my country. It takes place on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month when the moon is believed to be at its fullest and brightest.

On this day, families gather together to celebrate. We have a big dinner and enjoy looking at the beautiful full moon. The most famous food for this festival is the mooncake, which is a round pastry that often has a sweet filling. We share mooncakes with family and friends to express our love and best wishes. It’s a wonderful time for family reunions.

- 中秋节是我国最重要的传统节日之一。它在农历八月十五日举行，人们相信这一天的月亮最圆、最亮。
