## A postcard describing an interesting museum you visited
- 描述你参观过的一个有趣的博物馆的明信片

**正文**：

Hi Sarah,

Greetings from London! I visited the British Museum yesterday, and it was absolutely fascinating. The Rosetta Stone was incredible – much bigger than I imagined and truly a key to ancient languages. I also loved the Egyptian mummies; they were a bit spooky but so incredibly well-preserved and interesting. The sheer amount of history under one roof is amazing, covering cultures from all over the world. I spent nearly five hours there and still didn't manage to see everything. It’s a place where you could easily spend days exploring. You would absolutely love it here. Wish you were here to experience it with me!

See you soon,
Emily

- 嗨，莎拉，
- 伦敦问候！我昨天参观了大英博物馆，它真是太迷人了。
- 罗塞塔石碑令人难以置信——比我想象的要大得多，而且确实是解读古代语言的关键。
- 我也喜欢埃及木乃伊；它们有点吓人，但保存得非常好，非常有趣。
- 一个屋檐下汇集了如此多的历史，涵盖了世界各地的文化，真是令人惊叹。
- 我在那里待了将近五个小时，但仍然没有看完所有东西。这是一个你可以轻松花几天时间探索的地方。
- 你一定会喜欢这里的。希望你在这里和我一起体验！
- 回头见，
- 艾米丽

An Article About a Young Person Who Inspires Me

My younger sister, Lily, truly inspires me. She is only sixteen, but her dedication to environmental causes is remarkable. Last year, she started a recycling initiative at her school, which significantly reduced waste. She also volunteers every weekend at a local animal shelter, caring for abandoned pets. Lily is always reading about climate change and finding practical ways to make a difference. Her passion and commitment are infectious. She shows me that even small actions can lead to big changes, and that age is no barrier to making a positive impact on the world. I am incredibly proud of her efforts and her kind heart.
