Hi Sam,

I'm having an amazing time here in sunny Spain! The city is beautiful, and I've already learned so much. My host family is incredibly kind and their cooking is delicious. I'm practicing my Spanish every day, and it's getting much better.

Last weekend, we visited a famous museum and saw some incredible art. Tomorrow, we're going to the beach. I can't wait! The weather is perfect for swimming.

I've made lots of new friends from all over the world. I wish you were here to share this experience with me.

See you soon,
Alex
