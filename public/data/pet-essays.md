## An email to an online shop complaining about a delayed delivery
- [写给一家网店的投诉邮件，抱怨延迟交货]

**正文**：

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to complain about a delayed delivery. My order number is #12988, which I placed on September 1st. The order was for a blue jacket, and I was informed that it would be delivered within five working days.

However, it has now been ten days, and I still have not received my parcel. The tracking information has not been updated since September 3rd. I am very disappointed with this service as I needed the jacket for a trip this weekend.

Could you please investigate this matter immediately? I would like to know the status of my delivery. If you cannot guarantee its arrival within the next two days, I will have to request a full refund.

I look forward to your prompt reply.

Yours faithfully,
Chris Wang

- 我写这封信是为了投诉延迟交货。我的订单号是 #12988，于9月1日下单。订单商品是一件蓝色夹克，我被告知将在五个工作日内送达。
- 然而，现在已经过去十天了，我仍未收到我的包裹。物流信息自9月3日起就再也没有更新过。我对此服务感到非常失望，因为我本周末的旅行需要这件夹克。
- 您能否立即调查此事？我想知道我的货物的配送状态。如果您不能保证在未来两天内送达，我将不得不要求全额退款。
- 我期待您的及时回复。
- 诚挚的，
- 克里斯·王

## Write a story beginning: The phone rang at midnight and changed everything.
- [写一个以下列句子开头的故事：午夜时分，电话铃响了，一切都改变了。]

**正文**：

The phone rang at midnight and changed everything. I was half-asleep, but the caller's voice was urgent. It was my aunt, who I hadn't heard from in years. "Your grandfather left you something," she said, "a small bookshop in Paris. You need to come immediately."

I was shocked. I was a junior accountant living a boring life. A week later, I was standing in front of "Le Rêveur," a charming little shop with dusty windows. Inside, I found not just old books, but a letter from my grandfather. He wrote about a hidden treasure, not of gold, but of stories and secrets. My quiet life was over; a new adventure had just begun.

- 午夜时分，电话铃响了，一切都改变了。我当时半梦半醒，但来电者的声音非常急切。是我姑妈，一个我已多年未联系的亲人。她说：“你爷爷给你留下了一些东西，是巴黎的一家小书店。你需要马上过来。”
- 我惊呆了。我只是一名过着乏味生活的小会计。一周后，我站在了一家名为“梦想家”的迷人小店前，店面的窗户布满灰尘。在里面，我不仅找到了旧书，还有一封爷爷留下的信。信中他提到了一个隐藏的宝藏，不是金银，而是关于故事和秘密的宝藏。我平静的生活结束了，一场新的冒险才刚刚开始。
