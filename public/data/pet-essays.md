## A postcard describing an interesting museum you visited
- 一张描述你参观过的有趣博物馆的明信片

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

I'm having a fantastic time in the city! Yesterday, I visited the Natural History Museum, and it was amazing. The best part was the dinosaur exhibition. The skeletons were huge and looked so real! I also saw a fascinating display about ancient sea life, which had fossils of creatures from millions of years ago. The building itself is beautiful too. I took lots of photos to show you. I think you would really love it here.

See you soon,
Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 我在这座城市玩得非常开心！昨天，我参观了自然历史博物馆，简直太棒了。最精彩的部分是恐龙展览。那些骨架巨大无比，看起来非常逼真！我还看到了一个关于古代海洋生物的迷人陈列，里面有数百万年前的生物化石。博物馆建筑本身也很漂亮。我拍了很多照片给你看。我想你一定会喜欢这里的。
- 再见，
- 克里斯

## Write a story that begins: When I opened the old box, I found something incredible inside.
- 写一个以下列句子开头的故事：当我打开那个旧盒子时，我在里面发现了一些不可思议的东西。

**正文**：

When I opened the old box, I found something incredible inside. It was a small, dusty compass that looked ancient. As I cleaned it, I noticed strange symbols engraved on its silver case. Suddenly, the needle began to spin wildly before pointing firmly towards my bedroom wall. I thought it was broken, but when I moved, the needle moved too, always pointing to the same spot. I pushed against the wall and discovered a hidden door. My heart pounded with excitement as I wondered what secrets the compass would lead me to next.

- 当我打开那个旧盒子时，我在里面发现了一些不可思议的东西。那是一个小小的、布满灰尘的指南针，看起来很古老。当我擦拭它时，我注意到它银色的外壳上刻着奇怪的符号。突然，指针开始疯狂地旋转，然后坚定地指向我卧室的墙壁。我以为它坏了，但当我移动时，指针也跟着动，总是指向同一个地方。我推了一下墙，发现了一扇隐藏的门。我的心激动地怦怦直跳，好奇这个指南针接下来会带我发现什么秘密。
