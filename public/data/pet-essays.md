Hi Sam,

How are you doing? I'm writing to you because I've just finished a fantastic book and I think you would absolutely love it. It's called "The Night Circus" by Erin Morgenstern.

It’s a fantasy novel about a magical competition between two young magicians. The story is incredibly imaginative and the descriptions are so beautiful that I felt like I was really there. It’s not just a fantasy story; it’s also a beautiful love story. If you're looking for something magical and captivating to read, you should definitely give this a try.

Let me know what you think if you decide to read it!

Best,
Alex

My World in Focus

What do you do to relax and be creative? For me, the answer is photography. I started this hobby about a year ago, and it has completely changed the way I see the world. It’s not just about pointing a camera and clicking a button.

I love going for walks in the city or in the countryside, looking for interesting things to capture. It could be the beautiful light of a sunset, the smile on a stranger's face, or a colorful flower. This hobby has taught me to be more patient and to pay attention to small details. It’s a wonderful way to express myself and share the beauty I find with others. Photography is my passion, and it makes my life more exciting.

- 我的焦点世界
- 你会做什么来放松和发挥创造力？对我来说，答案是摄影。我大约一年前开始这个爱好，它完全改变了我看世界的方式。摄影不仅仅是拿起相机然后按下快门那么简单。
- 我喜欢在城市或乡间散步，寻找有趣的东西来拍摄。它可能是一抹美丽的夕阳，一个陌生人脸上的微笑，或是一朵色彩鲜艳的花。这个爱好教会了我更有耐心，并注意到微小的细节。这是一种表达自我、与他人分享我所发现的美的绝佳方式。摄影是我的热情所在，它让我的生活更加精彩。
