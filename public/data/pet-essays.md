## An email to an online shop complaining about a delayed delivery
- 一封向网店投诉延迟交货的邮件

**正文**：

Dear Customer Service,

I am writing to complain about a delayed delivery. My order number is 309301759. I purchased a blue jacket on your website on September 22nd, and the expected delivery date was September 29th. However, it is now October 2nd, and I still have not received my order.

The tracking information has not been updated for five days. I am very disappointed with this situation. Could you please check the status of my order immediately? I would appreciate it if you could tell me when I can expect to receive my jacket.

I look forward to your prompt reply.

Yours faithfully,
Chris

## Write a story about a day when everything went wrong
- 记述诸事不顺的一天

**正文**：

It all started when my alarm clock didn't go off. I woke up late and had to rush to get ready for school. In my hurry, I spilled orange juice all over my clean shirt. I quickly changed, but I knew it was a bad sign.

When I ran to the bus stop, I saw the bus pulling away. I had to walk to school and arrived just as the bell rang for my first class, which was a math test. I realized I had forgotten my calculator at home. After school, it started to rain heavily, and I didn't have an umbrella. It was truly a day where nothing went right.

- 一切都始于我的闹钟没有响。我醒得很晚，不得不匆忙准备上学。慌乱中，我把橙汁洒得到处都是，弄脏了我的干净衬衫。我迅速换了件衣服，但我知道这是个不好的预兆。
- 当我跑到公交车站时，我眼睁睁地看着公交车开走了。我只好步行去学校，当我到达时，第一节课的铃声正好响起，而那是一场数学考试。我发现我把计算器忘在家里了。放学后，天开始下起大雨，而我没有带伞。这真是诸事不顺的一天。
