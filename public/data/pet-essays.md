## An email to your headteacher suggesting a new school club
- 给校长写一封建议成立新学校社团的邮件

**正文**：

Dear Mr. Harrison,

I am writing to suggest a new school club: a Creative Writing Club.

Many students enjoy writing stories and poems, but we don't have a club for it. A writing club would be a wonderful place for us to share our work, receive feedback, and improve our skills together. We could hold weekly meetings to discuss ideas, run workshops on different writing styles, and perhaps even invite a local author to speak.

I believe this club would be very popular and a great addition to our school's activities.

Thank you for considering my suggestion.

Yours sincerely,

Alex Chen

- 尊敬的哈里森先生，
- 我写信是为了建议成立一个新的学校社团：创意写作社。
- 许多学生喜欢写故事和诗歌，但我们没有一个专门的社团。写作社将是一个很棒的地方，让我们分享作品、获得反馈并共同提高技能。我们可以每周开会讨论想法，举办关于不同写作风格的工作坊，甚至可以邀请一位本地作家来演讲。
- 我相信这个社团会非常受欢迎，并成为我们学校活动的一个重要补充。
- 感谢您考虑我的建议。
- 此致，
- Alex Chen

**正文**：

My big hiking trip to the mountains was canceled because of a storm. I was so disappointed and thought my weekend would be incredibly boring. Seeing my sad face, my grandmother suggested I explore the old attic. It was dusty and filled with forgotten things. In a corner, I found an old wooden chest. Inside were my grandfather's journals, filled with hand-drawn maps of our town and notes about "hidden treasures" in the local park. I spent the entire weekend following his clues, discovering a tiny hidden waterfall and a secret garden I never knew existed. I realized that sometimes the best adventures happen close to home.

- 我重要的山区远足之旅因为一场风暴而取消了。我非常失望，觉得我的周末会无聊透顶。
- 奶奶看到我悲伤的脸，建议我去探索一下旧阁楼。那里布满灰尘，堆满了被遗忘的东西。在一个角落里，我发现了一个旧木箱。里面是我祖父的日记，画满了我们小镇的手绘地图，还有关于本地公园里“隐藏宝藏”的笔记。
- 我花了整个周末跟着他的线索，发现了一个我从未知道存在的小瀑布和一个秘密花园。我意识到，有时最棒的冒险就在家附近。
