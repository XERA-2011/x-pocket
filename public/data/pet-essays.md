Hi everyone,

I'm having a fantastic time here in Rome! The weather is amazing – sunny and warm every day. I've been exploring the city and have already seen the Colosseum and the Roman Forum. They were absolutely incredible to see in person.

The food is delicious, especially the pasta and gelato. I don't think I've ever eaten so much ice cream! Tomorrow, I'm planning to visit the Vatican City. I can't wait to see St. Peter's Basilica.

Wish you were here!

Love,
Alex

- 大家好，
- 我在罗马玩得非常开心！这里天气好极了——每天都是阳光明媚，非常暖和。我一直在探索这座城市，已经参观了罗马斗兽场和古罗马广场。亲眼看到这些古迹真是太不可思议了。
- 这里的食物很美味，特别是意大利面和冰淇淋。我感觉自己从来没吃过这么多冰淇淋！明天，我计划去参观梵蒂冈城。我迫不及待想看看圣彼得大教堂。
- 真希望你们也在这里！
- 爱你们的，
- 亚历克斯

## Write a story about finding something mysterious in your garden
- 写一个关于在你的花园里发现神秘事物的故事

**正文**：

One sunny afternoon, I was helping my dad in the garden. While I was digging near an old oak tree, my shovel hit something hard. I thought it was just a rock, but I was curious and kept digging. Soon, I uncovered a small, wooden box. It was very old and had strange symbols carved on the lid.

I called my dad over to look. He had never seen it before. We tried to open it, but it was locked and there was no keyhole. I felt so excited and a little scared. What could be inside?

- 一个阳光明媚的下午，我正在花园里帮爸爸干活。当我在一棵老橡树附近挖土时，我的铲子碰到了一个硬物。我以为只是一块石头，但出于好奇，我继续往下挖。很快，我挖出了一个小木盒子。它非常古老，盖子上还刻着奇怪的符号。
- 我叫爸爸过来看。他以前也从未见过这个盒子。我们试着打开它，但它被锁住了，而且没有钥匙孔。我感到非常兴奋，又有点害怕。里面到底会是什么呢？
