My Favorite Hobby

Do you have a hobby that makes you truly happy? For me, that’s photography. I got my first camera two years ago as a birthday gift, and I have loved taking pictures ever since.

I enjoy photography because it allows me to capture special moments, like a beautiful sunset or my friends laughing. It helps me see the world differently, paying more attention to details and colors around me. On weekends, I often go to the park or walk around the city to find interesting things to photograph. It’s a wonderful way to relax and be creative.
