## An email to a friend apologizing for something you did
- [写给朋友的道歉信]

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

I’m writing to say I’m really sorry for missing your birthday party last Saturday. I know I promised I would be there, but my train was delayed for over two hours, and by the time I got back to town, the party was already over. My phone battery had also died, so I couldn't even call to let you know.

I feel awful about it and I hope you can understand. It was completely out of my control. I’ve got a small gift for you. I'd love to see you soon to give it to you.

Best,
Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 我写信是为了对我错过了上周六你的生日派对表示真诚的歉意。我知道我答应了会去的，但是我的火车晚点了两个多小时，等我回到城里时，派对已经结束了。我的手机也恰好没电了，所以甚至没法打电话通知你。
- 我对此感到非常糟糕，希望你能理解。这完全超出了我的控制。我为你准备了一份小礼物，希望能尽快见到你并亲手交给你。
- 最好的祝愿，
- 克里斯

## A story about a pet that did something amazing
- [一个关于宠物做了了不起事情的故事]

**正文**：

My dog, Buster, is usually a very calm and quiet golden retriever. However, one afternoon, he did something truly amazing that I'll never forget. I was working in my garden when I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my chest and fell to the ground. I couldn't move or call for help.

Buster seemed to understand something was seriously wrong. He started barking loudly and ran to the front gate, scratching at it frantically. My neighbour heard the noise and came to investigate. He saw me and immediately called an ambulance. The doctors said Buster's quick actions saved my life.

- 我的狗狗巴斯特通常是一只非常冷静和安静的金毛寻回犬。然而，一天下午，它做了一件我永生难忘的了不起的事情。我当时正在花园里干活，突然感到胸口一阵剧痛，然后摔倒在地。我无法动弹，也无法呼救。
- 巴斯特似乎明白了情况严重。它开始大声吠叫，并跑到前门，疯狂地抓门。我的邻居听到了噪音，过来查看情况。他发现了我，并立即叫了救护车。医生说，是巴斯特的迅速反应救了我的命。
