## A letter to the school principal suggesting an improvement
- 一封给校长的建议信

**正文**：

Dear Principal Smith,

My name is Li Hua, and I am a student in Class 2, Grade 9. I am writing to suggest an improvement for our school library.

Currently, the library's opening hours are quite limited, especially on weekends. Many students, including myself, would like to use the library for studying and research on Saturdays and Sundays. However, it is always closed. I believe that extending the library's hours to include weekends would provide us with a quiet and resourceful place to study, which would surely help improve our academic performance.

Thank you for considering my suggestion.

Yours sincerely,
Li Hua

- 尊敬的史密斯校长：
- 我是九年级二班的学生李华。我写信是为了对我们学校的图书馆提出一项改进建议。
- 目前，图书馆的开放时间非常有限，尤其是在周末。包括我自己在内的许多同学都希望能在周六和周日使用图书馆学习和查阅资料，但它总是关闭的。我相信将图书馆的开放时间延长至周末，能为我们提供一个安静且资源丰富的学习场所，这无疑将有助于我们提升学业成绩。
- 感谢您考虑我的建议。
- 此致，
- 李华

## An article about a famous person you admire
- 一篇关于你敬佩的名人的文章

**正文**：

The famous person I admire most is J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series. Before she became a world-famous writer, she faced many difficulties in her life. She was a single mother and struggled with poverty. However, she never gave up on her dream of writing.

Her stories have brought joy and imagination to millions of people around the world. What I admire most about her is her persistence and creativity. She taught me that no matter how difficult life gets, we should always hold on to our dreams and work hard to achieve them.

- 我最敬佩的名人是《哈利·波特》系列的作者J.K.罗琳。
- 在成为世界著名作家之前，她的生活面临诸多困境。她曾是一位单身母亲，在贫困中挣扎。然而，她从未放弃自己的写作梦想。
- 她的故事为全世界数百万人带来了欢乐和想象力。我最敬佩的是她的坚持不懈和创造力。她教会我，无论生活变得多么艰难，我们都应该坚守梦想并为之努力奋斗。
