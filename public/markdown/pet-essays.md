## A story about overcoming a fear
- 一个关于克服恐惧的故事

**正文**：

I had always been terrified of heights. The mere thought of standing on a high balcony made my legs tremble. Last summer, my friends invited me to go rock climbing. Initially, I refused, but they encouraged me to just give it a try.

At the climbing center, I stared at the tall wall, my heart pounding. With the instructor's guidance and my friends cheering me on, I took the first step. It was difficult, but I kept going, focusing only on the next hold. When I finally reached the top, I felt an incredible sense of achievement. I had faced my fear and won.

- 我一直都非常恐高。只要一想到站在高处的阳台上，我的双腿就会发抖。去年夏天，我的朋友们邀请我去攀岩。起初我拒绝了，但他们鼓励我至少去试一试。
- 在攀岩中心，我盯着高高的墙壁，心跳加速。在教练的指导和朋友们的加油声中，我迈出了第一步。过程很艰难，但我没有放弃，只专注于下一个抓手。当我最终到达顶端时，我感受到了一种不可思议的成就感。我战胜了我的恐惧。
