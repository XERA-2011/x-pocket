## An email to a friend recommending a new restaurant you tried
- 一封向朋友推荐你尝试过的新餐厅的邮件

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

How are you? I'm writing to tell you about an amazing new Italian restaurant I tried last weekend. It's called "The Pasta House" and it's just opened in the city center, near the main library.

The food was absolutely delicious! I had the seafood spaghetti, and it was the best I've ever tasted. The atmosphere was really cozy and the staff were very friendly, too. It wasn't too expensive either, which was a bonus.

We should definitely go there together sometime soon. Let me know when you're free!

Best,

Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 你好吗？我写信是想告诉你，我上周末尝试了一家超棒的新意大利餐厅。它叫“意大利面小屋”，就在市中心，靠近主图书馆。
- 食物真的非常美味！我点了海鲜意面，那是我吃过的最棒的。餐厅的氛围也很舒适，员工们非常友好。价格也不算太贵，这算是个惊喜。
- 我们近期一定要一起去一次。告诉我你什么时候有空！
- 祝好，
- 克里斯
