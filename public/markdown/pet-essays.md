## An email to a friend asking for advice about choosing a university course
- 给朋友写一封邮件，就选择大学课程征求建议

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

How are you? I'm writing to you because I really need your advice. I'm trying to decide what to study at university, and I'm feeling a bit lost.

I've always been interested in technology and computers, so I was thinking about a computer science course. However, I also enjoy art and design, and I'm wondering if I should choose something more creative, like graphic design. You know me so well and you're already at university. What do you think would be a better fit for me? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Best,
Chris

## Write a story about an unexpected message you received
- 写一个关于你收到的意想不到的消息的故事

**正文**：

Last Tuesday, I was studying in the library when my phone buzzed. It was a message from an unknown number. "Is this Sarah? I found a wallet with your name inside," it read. I checked my bag and realised my wallet was gone! I felt so panicked.

I replied immediately, and the person told me they were at a café near the library. I rushed over and met a kind old lady who handed me my wallet. Nothing was missing. I was so relieved and grateful. It was an unexpected message, but it saved my day and restored my faith in strangers.

- 上周二，我正在图书馆学习，这时我的手机响了。是一条来自未知号码的消息。上面写着：“是莎拉吗？我找到了一个里面有你名字的钱包。”我检查了我的包，发现我的钱包不见了！我感到非常恐慌。
- 
- 我立刻回复了，那个人告诉我他们在图书馆附近的一家咖啡馆。我赶过去，遇到了一位和蔼的老太太，她把我的钱包递给了我。什么都没少。我感到非常宽慰和感激。这是一条意想不到的消息，但它拯救了我的一天，也让我重新相信了陌生人。
