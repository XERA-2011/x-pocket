# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to standardize the entire project's visual styling to a consistent black and white theme. The goal is to create a unified, elegant aesthetic that eliminates all non-black-white color variations while maintaining visual appeal through strategic use of gradients, transparency, and contrast. This will ensure a cohesive user experience across all pages and components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want all pages to have a consistent black background with white text, so that the interface feels unified and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page THEN the system SHALL display a pure black (#000000) background
2. WHEN a user views any text content THEN the system SHALL display it in pure white (#FFFFFF) 
3. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent black background across all routes
4. IF a component has a background color THEN the system SHALL use only black, transparent, or semi-transparent black variants

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all interactive elements to follow the black and white theme, so that the interface remains visually consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over buttons or links THEN the system SHALL show visual feedback using only black, white, or transparent variations
2. WHEN a user interacts with form elements THEN the system SHALL style them with black backgrounds and white text/borders
3. WHEN a user sees navigation elements THEN the system SHALL display them using only the approved color palette
4. IF an element needs emphasis THEN the system SHALL use white-to-transparent gradients or opacity variations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized styling system, so that the black and white theme can be maintained consistently across the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN styles are defined THEN the system SHALL use CSS custom properties for color values
2. WHEN components need styling THEN the system SHALL reference global color variables
3. WHEN new components are added THEN the system SHALL enforce the black and white color scheme through the global styles
4. IF gradients are used THEN the system SHALL only allow black-to-transparent, white-to-transparent, or black-to-white gradients

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual hierarchy and depth to be maintained despite the monochrome palette, so that the interface remains usable and aesthetically pleasing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content needs visual separation THEN the system SHALL use semi-transparent overlays or borders
2. WHEN elements need depth THEN the system SHALL use box-shadows with black or white colors at various opacities
3. WHEN gradients are applied THEN the system SHALL create smooth transitions between black, white, and transparent states
4. IF text needs emphasis THEN the system SHALL use opacity variations, font weights, or semi-transparent backgrounds

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing colored elements to be converted to the black and white theme, so that no inconsistent colors remain in the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system loads any component THEN it SHALL display no colors other than black, white, and their transparent variants
2. WHEN images or icons are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure they fit the monochrome aesthetic or apply appropriate filters
3. WHEN animations or transitions occur THEN the system SHALL use only approved color values
4. IF any non-conforming colors are detected THEN the system SHALL override them with appropriate black/white alternatives
